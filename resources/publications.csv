Until 5 July 2016, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 17 729 artificial objects including 1419 operational satellites[1]. Information about the current position of these objects should be taken into consideration while planning space missions. There are various solutions to cope with the problem considered. The main objective was to design a low-cost system that would detect objects which do not emit their own signal and can cause collision with spacecrafts. The reception system is based on Doppler detection. One of the methods of gathering information about space objects which are changing their position relatively to the Earth is using the continuous wave reflection. The reflected outgoing sinusoidal wave is Doppler-shifted to higher or lower frequency according to whether it has a line of sight velocity towards or away from the receiver. It is also common to use this method for meteor detection. In this project we use signal emitted by the Graves Radar. Graves is a French radar-based space surveillance system which transmitter is located in the east of France and generates continuous wave with a frequency 143,05 MHz. In order to receive the reflected signal we built the passive radar which works on frequency similar to Graves. It is located 15 km to the south of Warsaw centre, thanks to its position it is possible to avoid radio noise coming from the city. Our construction includes directional antenna designed for 144 MHz and FUNcube Dongle Pro+. The FUNcube Dongle Pro+ is a software-defined radio (SDR) covering all broadcast andamateur radio bands from 150 kHz to 1,9 GHz. We use Orbitron as a software. Orbitron is an application related to satellite tracking. We can predict what kind of data will we receive from our construction by verifying it in application. Our first tests of the system were performed on objects with a well known trajectory and velocity. Also a correlation with data from two-line element set (TLE) was made. TLE is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time. Results show spectrogram of a signal reflected from satellite with a Doppler shift that fits our expectations. The flying object generated a Doppler shift of about 10 kHz below the carrier frequency. Although the first data come from objects with a large size and mass above 1 ton, in further observations we expect to receive reflection from satellites which mass is less than 10 kg.",,978-1-5090-6755-8,10.1109/SPS.2017.8053660,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053660,,Satellites;Orbits;Extraterrestrial measurements;Radar tracking;Satellite broadcasting,artificial satellites;directive antennas;Doppler shift;passive radar;radar antennas;satellite tracking;software radio;space debris;spaceborne radar,space debris;United States Strategic Command;space missions;low-cost system;reception system;Doppler detection;continuous wave reflection;meteor detection;Graves Radar;passive radar;frequency similar;Warsaw centre;radio noise;broadcast andamateur radio bands;satellite tracking;two-line element set;orbital elements;Earth-orbiting object;Doppler shift;flying object;carrier frequency;LEO satellites;space object detection;French radar-based space surveillance system;directional antenna;FUNcube Dongle Pro+;software-defined radio;SDR;frequency 10.0 kHz;frequency 150.0 kHz to 19.0 GHz;frequency 144.0 MHz,,1,9,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

The solutions used by many countries, including France and the United States are complex as well as expensive. The aim of the project in question was to establish an affordable and simple radar-based surveillance system allowing to detect, track and catalogue objects in the outer space. The main elements used were: a Yagi antenna with proper equipment as a Doppler-shifted signal receiver, two programs for raw data analysis and orbit fitting as well as a database containing information about detected satellites. Basing on the frequency of signals emitted by the Graves radar, an object orbit estimation was made using a C++ program and then stored in a database. The phenomenon of relativistic Doppler effect was considered while analysing the data. The amplitude of signal gave the frequency as function of time. Next, a circular orbit approximation was found and saved to the database. On average 1176 satellite flights have been registered every week so far. The total cost of the system did not exceed €430, whereas the whole ESA's Space Situational Awareness Programme needs a budget of €95 million. It was possible to create a low-cost and uncomplicated part of a SSA system.

In this work we present and discuss our solutions of photonic integrated interrogators for application in a novel fiber-optic sensing system, dedicated to monitoring condition of a patient exposed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning procedure. The monitoring system makes use of multiple fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based sensors, which offer the advantages of high sensitivity and immunity to strong magnetic fields and simultaneously do not affect the results of an MRI scan. Furthermore, the fact that many gratings can be inscribed within a single optical fiber simplifies the architecture of the sensing network. Basically, two main approaches to interrogate FBG-based sensors can be distinguished. The first uses a broadband optical signal, which is coupled into the fiber-optic sensing network, while the reflected spectrum is monitored using a spectrometer, typically equipped with a number of detectors. In the second approach a monochromatic, wavelength-swept light is used to scan the sensors and the reflected signal is detected using a single photodetector. The solutions presented and discussed in this work are based on the first approach and make use of generic technology of photonic integration It should be noted that the majority of commercially available photonic interrogators are realized in a form of bulky devices, consisting of a number of discrete optoelectronics components. That is why they have significant disadvantages: relatively large dimensions, bulky design and considerable power consumption. On the contrary, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer compact design, energy efficiency, high reliability as well as reduced fabrication and packaging costs. In our research we are trying to benefit from all these features. In this work we present and discuss the properties of a test series of integrated interrogators manufactured using generic InP technology [1] and differing in details of design and the number of wavelength channels available. R&D works enabled comparison of the performance parameters of all devices and, finally, determination of the most promising solution, based on 36-channel arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) with 75 GHz and 50 GHz channel spacing, shown in Fig. 1. The photonic integrated chip shown comprises two interrogators, both equipped with two optical inputs - one with built-in semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and the second without SOA. A series of experiments that was carried out confirmed design assumptions. Fabricated structures with 50 GHz and 75 GHz AWG have 0.4 nm (Fig lb) and 0.6 nm channel spacings and free spectral ranges (FSR) 14.4 mu and 21.6 nm respectively, as designed. Furthermore, application of the built-in SOA appeared to increase signal by 10 dB, allowing interrogators working better with low-level input optical signals. The signal reflected from an FBG was reconstructed successfully by the interrogator. Finally, the Bragg wavelength shift due to strain applied to an FBG was reconstructed, demonstrating a possibility of monitoring the changes of strain induced on the sensors on the MRI bed, which is a result of the patient's breath movements.",,978-1-7281-0469-0,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8873399,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873399,,Fiber gratings;Photonics;Optical fiber sensors;Arrayed waveguide gratings;Semiconductor optical amplifiers,biomedical MRI;Bragg gratings;fibre optic sensors;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics,breath movement;MRI bed;low-level input optical signal;photonic integrated chip;arrayed waveguide gratings;generic InP technology;photonic integrated circuits;single photodetector;spectrometer;reflected spectrum;broadband optical signal;fiber optic sensor networks;sensing network;single optical fiber;MRI scan;strong magnetic fields;multiple fiber Bragg grating based sensors;monitoring system;magnetic resonance imaging scanning procedure;monitoring condition;fiber-optic sensing system;photonic integrated interrogators,,,1,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

The basic idea is to infer the position and altitude of an aerial platform by making a comparison between a SAR image and an optical image or digital terrain model (DTM). To obtain estimates of the coordinate drifts, a few algorithmic approaches have been proposed. Such a system can also be used in GPS denied environments, or for high-speed maneuvering platforms where GPS navigation is unable to work properly. It can also be used as an additional landing assistant platform for civilian aircraft, especially in bad weather conditions or when an airport is not equipped with modern electronic devices such as an Instrument Landing System (ILS).",,978-1-7281-1715-7,10.1109/SPS.2019.8882066,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882066,navigation;GPS denied environments;Synthetic Aperture Radar;SAR;SAR aided navigation;radar aided navigation;INS.,Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Aircraft navigation;Spaceborne radar;Finite impulse response filters,aircraft navigation;inertial navigation;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar,SAR image;digital terrain model;GPS navigation;Instrument Landing System;Synthetic Aperture Radar images;Inertial Navigation System measurements;x-band SAR-based Navigation aid System;landing assistant platform,,1,23,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant mortality and morbidity is related to occurrence of AF arrhythmia due to high risk of hospitalization, stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease, etc. In many cases AF may not produce any symptoms and may go unnoticed by a patient, which is why there is a high importance to develop methods of detecting this heart disorder. Creating an algorithm for AF and other arrhythmias classification of short-term single lead ECG signals was the aim of the PhysioNet Challenge 2017. The database was composed by over 8.5 thousand ECG recordings (between 10 sec and 60 sec length) measured by AliveCor device, provided by organizers. We prepared an alternative hybrid approach for QRS detection in order to obtain RR time intervals. It consists of two complementary methods in hierarchical order: one based on nonlinear transformation and first-order Gaussian differentiator as superior and another one proposed in sample entry as inferior. We introduce the machine learning algorithm in order to classify whether it is normal sinus rhythm, AF or an alternative heart rhythm using features considered regularity of RR time intervals and morphology of the ECG signal. The separate part of the algorithm based on beat averaging method is dedicated for preceding extraction of too noisy recordings from the input to the classifier.

These errors result primarily from the presence of a gap in the inner conductor. Our approach relies on an approximate model of the connector interface that comprises an analytical equivalent-circuit for the inner conductor gap section and a behavioral scattering-parameter model for the socket-contact section. We verify this model using full-wave electromagnetic simulations for the 1.85, 2.4, 3.5 mm, and Type-N coaxial-connector interface for different inner conductor-gap widths. We further apply this model to asses first-order errors in VNA calibration introduced by the tolerance on the inner conductor-gap width. We show that the inner conductor-gap effect can be accounted for with a series inductance inserted at the inner conductor mating-plane while the effect of the socket contact can be lumped into the VNA calibration coefficients. We verify this error model experimentally by measuring a Type-N offset load with an adjustable inner conductor gap. We also demonstrate that including our error model in coaxial offset-short definitions leads to improved consistency of a one-port VNA calibration with 3.5-mm coaxial offset-short standards.

Beam switching is achieved by reconfigurable arrangement of a set of slots. Complementary RRSs connected to the electromechanical RF switch is used to generate remaining -30° and -45° beams. The gain of each generated beam is similar because different numbers of slots are opened, i.e., three, five, and nine slots for beams directed toward 0°, 30°, and 45°, respectively.

It is assumed that packets, periodically generated at the sensors at the beginning of each consecutive time frame, are to be delivered to (Internet) gateways. Although in the nominal network condition it is sufficient when the packet streams produced by each sensor reach one of the gateways, from resilience viewpoint it would be advantageous to deliver them to multiple gateways, preferably using the broadcast capability of wireless nodes. Clearly, under the assumption of periodic packet traffic, a longer frame must be used when packets are to be delivered (without losses) to multiple gateways rather to single gateways. Since traffic throughput (one packet per stream per frame) is inversely proportional to the frame length, a clear tradeoff between resilience and traffic throughput arises. In the paper we present a numerical study, using a modification of our previous optimization model for frame length minimization in the considered kind of networks, that illustrates the relation between the frame length and the number of gateways each packet stream is supposed to reach. A general conclusion is that the frame length increase is non-negligible when multiple gateways are assumed, and depends heavily on the way the resulting multicast traffic is handled and how the particular subsets of gateways are selected for particular streams.",,978-1-7281-6300-0,10.1109/DRCN48652.2020.1570610581,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089345,Wireless sensor networks;resilience;traffic throughput;multicast;transmission scheduling;mixed-integer programming;IoT,Throughput;Logic gates;Wireless sensor networks;Optimization;Resilience;Sensors;Spread spectrum communication,Internet;minimisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks,radio channel;Internet;resilience viewpoint;consecutive time frame;time division multiple access;multihop wireless sensor networks;multicast traffic;packet stream;frame length minimization;traffic throughput;periodic packet traffic;wireless nodes,,,17,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently deployed access networks mostly make use of copper cables like a twisted pair or a coaxial cable [1]. It seems, however, that they do not provide sufficient data rates to fulfil continuously increasing needs for broadband telecommunication services. One of the most promising approaches for providing high-speed, all-optical, symmetric transmission of digital signals are passive optical networks using the wavelength division multiplexing technique (WDM-PON) [2]. WDM-PON access systems can offer large capacity, high transmission rate and data security. On the other hand, they require low-cost, highly reliable devices of high overall performance. It seems that the photonic integration technology based on indium phosphide is a platform of choice to meet these requirements, as it enables fabrication of compact, reliable and energy efficient devices in a form of monolithic chips, comprising multiple active and passive components.

For that purpose, a new scalar 1-D layered electromagnetic (EM) model of the resonator is proposed. The model takes the advantage of Cartesian-to-Gaussian coordinate transformation and axisymmetrical properties of the TEM modes of interest. There are several advantages of the proposed approach. The first is the use of Gaussian mirrors instead of spherical ones, which better fit to the shape of Gaussian wavefronts. Second, the model more accurately accounts for oblique incidence of the wave onto the surface of the sample, which is one of the major challenges in case of alternative models based on a characteristic equation. An automated measurement setup operating in the 20-50-GHz range has been designed and manufactured to experimentally validate the proposed measurement method.

The largest differences in IQE spectra measured between 100 and 300 K were observed in the wavelength range, corresponding to the light absorbed exclusively in the CIGS layer. Absorbers in the investigated cells were grown using a one-stage process. Since all elements are supplied at a constant rate, the obtained layers are free of the band gap grading, therefore collection in the bulk of the layer is not affected by a quasi-electrical field. This allows us to discuss temperature changes in collection solely in terms of recombination. We associate the change in IQE with recombination via defects present in the bulk of absorber. The two cases of donor and acceptor defects are discussed. Using SCAPS software and basic handbook formulas that describe the emission and capture rates of carriers, we estimate a range of basic parameters of the possible bulk defects in CIGS that are responsible for the temperature change of IQE spectra. Our results suggest that IQE may be controlled by shallow defects of ionization energy of 45 and 60 meV for the donor and acceptor cases, respectively. We calculate IQE spectra at different temperatures.

It shows how the two most important systems in the human body act to function efficiently. The effect that is believed to show these dependencies is Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), which causes accelerations of heart rate during inspiration and decelerates the rhythm during passive act of expiration. There are many methods to analyse the occurrence of RSA, from the basic peak-to-valley method, to more complicated ones as e.g. spectral coherence. But all of them have flaws like omitting samples or giving only a single value for the entire analysed period. In this paper, we present a simple, numeric method, which enables the analysis of the changes in the strength of RSA over the time. Our solution is called Cardiorespiratory Coupling Assessment (CCA) and calculates the value of RSA in consecutive, one-minute long windows as the median of the differences of RR intervals detected during expiration and inspiration in each window. The data necessary for the CCA method to work properly includes ECG and the respiratory signal from the chest belt measured simultaneously. In our research, we first analysed the performance of the method on synthetically generated data to verify its performance. Than we compared short 5 minute recordings obtained during spontaneous and controlled breathing and then analysed 4 hours long signals extracted from nighttime recordings. The results show that the CCA method allows to measure accurately the changes in strength of RSA over the time in both short and long signals. Moreover, the results indicate that the level of the RSA strength is larger in recordings from spontaneous breathing phase than from the controlled breathing.",2325-887X,978-1-5386-6630-2,10.22489/CinC.2017.154-409,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331564,,Electrocardiography;Couplings;Belts;Cardiology;Time-domain analysis;Physics;Autonomic nervous system,cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics,controlled breathing;CCA method;short signals;RSA strength;universal method;arrhythmia;human body act;heart rate;inspiration;peak-to-valley method;complicated ones;single value;entire analysed period;simple method;numeric method;one-minute long windows;respiratory signal;autonomic nervous system;cardiorespiratory coupling assessment;ECG;time 5.0 min;time 4.0 hour,,,3,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Ge₁₋ₓSnₓ is an interesting material due to the possibility of tuning the band structure by changing the Sn content. The direct and indirect bandgap of GeSn can be changed to affect the direct and phonon-assisted band-to-band tunneling currents. In this article, both currents are calculated for various compositions of Ge₁₋ₓSnₓ and the channel body thickness as a parameter. The simulated structure exhibits steep-slope current-voltage characteristics due to the reduced carrier dimensionality and the use of 2-D-2-D tunneling as the transport mechanism. Sudden current bumps on characteristics are related to the alignment of the subsequent hole and electron energy levels in the gate-induced surface quantum wells. An increase in the Sn content results in a boost of the on-current, which is related to the higher magnitude of the direct tunneling current. This effect depends strongly on the body thickness. We show that the application of GeSn in EHB TFET structure can be beneficial in terms of low-power applications.",1557-9646,,10.1109/TED.2020.2993817,National Science Centre Poland; Foundation for Polish Science; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106788,2-D carrier gas;electron-hole bilayer tunnel field-effect transistor (EHB TFET);germanium-tin;interband tunneling;quantum mechanical modeling;semiconductor devices;tunnel transistor.,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,,,,,,,,,,,

The second application is related to the problem of creating proper decision rules which usually are present in System Dynamics models. In that case we substitute original decision rules by control variables and then define an optimal control problem whose performance index is used to verify the effectiveness of a particular decision rule. Having the solution of the optimal control problem we use it to modify the decision rule or its parameters.

Performing an attack on an unsecured device can be very simple and may not require expensive hardware. For this reason research and development of countermeasures against such attacks is very important. This paper presents an environment designed to facilitate research, development and evaluation of countermeasures protecting hardware implementation of cryptographic primitives against side-channel attacks based on power consumption analysis. The environment is composed of hardware cryptographic coprocessor with modular architecture, data transfer and configuration layers and software testbench for design verification. Different crypto primitives (block ciphers, hash functions, checksum) were implemented along with basic countermeasures. Utilized methods of power consumption approximation are also described.

Power electronics engineers are often in favour of multiresonant controllers whereas motion control designers more often incorporate iterative learning controllers (ILC) into their systems. Both camps of researchers seem to be entrenched and rarely willing to admit that both techniques are capable of introducing exactly the same generating polynomial to the system. Moreover, both techniques in their basic forms suffer from a lack of robustness to a persevering non-zero control error, e.g. due to the physical limitations on the plant side. To render the techniques practical, several tweaks have to be made. Neither of them is also innately immune to the reference and/or disturbance signal frequency fluctuations. Even small frequency variations at the level of 1% can render the basic ILC impractical in the case of the grid-tied converter discussed in this paper. The paper is supposed to serve as the second chapter of the conversational guide on the similarity and challenges of multiresonant and iterative learning controllers. Alongside sparking the discussion, our main contribution here is a novel conditional learning concept within the ILC, inspired by the variable damping proposed for multiresonant controllers. An improvement gained by augmenting the basic ILC with the conditional learning is illustrated based on numerical simulations. Further possibilities of introducing an adaptation algorithm into the modified controller are suggested.",,978-9-0758-1528-3,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515548,repetitive process control;multiresonant control;iterative learning control;repetitive disturbance rejection;grid-tie converter;frequency fluctuations;adaptive fractional delay filter;adaptive resonant term;conditional learning,Frequency control;Frequency conversion;Resonant frequency;Transient analysis;Robustness;Europe,adaptive control;control system synthesis;damping;electric current control;iterative learning control;iterative methods;learning systems;motion control;power convertors;power grids;robust control,iterative learning current controllers;repetitive process control engineers;multiresonant controllers;power electronics engineers;motion control designers;persevering nonzero control error;grid-tied converter;modified controller;iterative learning controllers;conditional learning concept,,,23,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

If impedance cardiography (ICG) signal tracks changes of blood volume within segment of thorax, it can be used to estimate Pwk(t) noninvasively in humans. During late diastole, according to reservoir-wave model Pao(t)= Pwk(t). Moreover, Pwk(t) in aorta and pressure in peripheral arteries should be similar. If these assumptions hold true, during late diastole, shapes of Pao(t), of pressure in peripheral arteries, and of impedance cardiography signal should be exponential decay curves with the same time constant. Parameters of exponential decay curves of radial pressure obtained with Finapres and of cardiac impedance were compared in 4 subjects. Different locations of ICG sensing electrodes were tested We found that degree of similarity between ICG and Finapres signals depends on the location of ICG sensing electrodes. Motion artifacts and O wave distorted ICG curves and diminished the similarity between the two curves. Least effected and most similar to decaying portion of radial pressure curve was the impedance signal obtained with sensing electrodes localized upon the abdominal aorta, but the shape of two signals still considerably varied.

A crucial requirement for providing proper functioning of the network and its security is proper isolation of slices. The aim of this paper is to propose a new method of determination of the isolation level of a slice. We propose a Graph-based model of the sliced network, which has a layered structure. In each layer, the appropriate network elements have their own isolation level. The lowest layer of the Graph-based model represents virtual network elements with isolation traits used for calculating their isolation level. Climbing to the top of the stack of layers one can calculate, successively, isolation level for a network's physical element, a link, subnetworks and, the End-to-End slice's isolation level.

Such devices require extremely stable phase and time synchronization by means of high frequency signals distributed along the accelerator facility. Coaxial cables are frequently used to distribute the reference signal over the large machine to synchronize electronic systems. These cables are the main source of undesirable phase drifts in the synchronization system. Signal phase drifts in cables are mainly caused by temperature and humidity variations and their values usually exceed required phase synchronization accuracy by more than an order of magnitude. Air pressure can also influence on the signal phase drifts but with a much smaller impact than from temperature and humidity changes. There are several approaches to reduce signal phase drifts in coaxial cables. This paper describes the realization of an active phase stabilization system based on the interference phenomenon. A phase-locked signal from the transmitter is reflected at the end of a coaxial cable link. Directional couplers placed along the cable pick up the forward and reflected signals and interfere them to cancel out the cable phase drifts.

Afterwards, a simulation model in Saber was developed on the base of manufacturer's preliminary data and adjusted in reference to results of experiments. Then, this model was applied to perform simulations of the module operating in a square-wave-controlled half-bridge inverter.

Recent years observed significant development of the technology of luminescent materials for application in light sources (both coherent and incoherent) operating in the visible part of the spectrum. Undoubtedly, the most spectacular results have been obtained in the field of wide bandgap semiconductor lasers, considerable progress has been also observed in solid state lasers based on crystalline or glassy hosts with frequency conversion. Despite this results, however, there is still a room for development of entirely new types of active media, like e.g. composite polymers doped with optically active nanocrystals. Such a materials may potentially benefit from excellent luminescent properties of RE3+ doped nanocrystals and good optical and thermo-mechanical properties of polymer matrices enabling drawing the optical fibers based on these composites. In such a design nanocrystalline environment provides the protection of active ions from interactions with highly energetic phonons of polymer matrix and simultaneously, polymer host encapsulating nanoparticles shields these from interactions with OH- groups and other contaminations. In this work we summarize the results of our research on design and development of the first PMMA-based optically active composite fiber, activated with rare-earth ions introduced in a form of active nanocrystals. The set of Tm3++Yb3+ doped nanocrystalline samples based on oxide and fluoride crystals of different dopant concentration was synthesized using precipitation method. All manufactured samples were carefully examined by means of classical optical spectroscopy - in particular excitation and emission spectra together with luminescence dynamic profiles have been recorded and analyzed with specific focus on up-conversion excitation schemes. The optimal pumping wavelengths were experimentally verified using a unique pressure tuned semiconductor laser diodes. For samples with optimal luminescent properties the bulk composites based on PMMA polymer doped with Tm3++Yb3+:YF3 nanocrystals were manufactured and carefully tested.",,978-1-5090-6736-7,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086668,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086668,,Optical fibers;Plastics;Frequency conversion;Nanocrystals;Particle beam optics;Optical pumping,nanofabrication;nanoparticles;nanophotonics;optical fibre fabrication;optical frequency conversion;optical polymers;optical pumping;photoluminescence;polymer fibres;precipitation (physical chemistry);thulium;visible spectra;ytterbium;yttrium compounds,"oxide crystals;fluoride crystals;dopant concentration;precipitation method;classical optical spectroscopy;excitation spectra;emission spectra;luminescence dynamic profiles;up-conversion excitation schemes;optimal pumping wavelengths;unique pressure tuned semiconductor laser diodes;optimal luminescent properties;bulk composites;PMMA polymer;Tm3++Yb3+:YF3 nanocrystals;Tm3++Yb3+ doped nanocrystalline samples;rare-earth ions;PMMA-based optically active composite fiber;polymer host encapsulating nanoparticles;polymer matrix;highly energetic phonons;active ions;nanocrystalline environment;optical fibers;polymer matrices;thermo-mechanical properties;optical properties;RE3+ doped nanocrystals;optically active nanocrystals;composite polymers;frequency conversion;glassy hosts;crystalline hosts;solid state lasers;wide bandgap semiconductor lasers;light sources;luminescent materials;VIS spectral range;polymer-based composite active fiber;YF3:Tm3+,Yb3+",,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

After launch, information on rocket's trajectory is obviously very desirable as it allows for the verification of parameters of propulsion and guidance systems. The rocket itself can be equipped with measurement systems based on a global navigation satellite system and/or inertial navigation system. These, however, do not solve all the problems. The measurement equipment onboard the rocket is prone to damage and failures due to the extreme operating conditions (such as great acceleration). Moreover, if the data is not sent to the ground station during the flight, but stored onboard, the rocket has to be located after landing to download the data. This is not always possible, as the rocket's landing position may be difficult to estimate. For these reasons, additional sensor for measuring rocket trajectory is desirable. In this article, the analysis of using passive radar for the detection and tracking of rockets is considered.

Stability improvement is achieved by using dual-timer protection with shorter safety margin for multi-phase faults close to the power plant and longer safety margin for remote multi-phase faults and single-phase faults. The use of the output signal obtained for a short safety margin depends on how the substation is configured. In the breaker-and-a-half configuration, this output signal is used to speed up the opening of all adjacent circuit breakers. In substations with the dual (or triple) busbar configuration the output signal obtained with a short safety margin is used to speed up the busbar splitting. A case study was performed for a real large-scale power system. Simulation results confirmed the advantages of the proposed logic.

It is well known that, in current implementations, CAN has been widely used in the control system design of automotive powertrains. However, on the other hand, the application of CAN would not only lead to network-induced delays but also bring about protocol constrains, e.g., data package capability and utilization ratio limitation, which would deteriorate the system and make the controller design a challenging problem. This paper is to provide a co-design methodology that can cope with all these problems and ensure satisfactory control effect for the speed synchronization control of IMT powertrain systems. First, a networked IMT powertrain system using CAN as underlying network is presented and the dynamic model for the speed synchronization control is derived. Second, the network-induced delay model is introduced and improved considering data packet capability and utilization ratio limitation. The control-orient discrete-time model is also derived based on the improved delay model.

This solution is known to be a significant source of interfering disturbances for a railway signaling system. Therefore, the amplitudes of current harmonics generated by railway vehicles should fulfil the assumed limits. This paper presents the process of determining the optimized modulation technique for VSI with IM. The aim of the work was to determine a switching strategy for VSI with respect to the dc-link current harmonics limits established for railway applications. The presented procedure is a combination of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and analytical frequency-domain approach for dc-link current harmonics calculation. It allows combining restrictions on harmonics in DC-link and in windings of the motor during a single optimization process. For calculations of dc-link current harmonics, the convolution of VSI output current and voltage harmonics was utilized and described. The developed modulation technique was applied in a laboratory scale VSI drive. Finally, the validity of theoretical consideration was confirmed by comparing the analytical results and laboratory measurements. The optimized switching strategy is suitable for application in the railway vehicles supplied with DC traction systems.",1557-9948,,10.1109/TIE.2019.2946543,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870248,DC-link current;harmonics convolution;PSO;SHE;traction vehicle;voltage source inverter,Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Optimization;Inverters;Switches;Rail transportation;Modulation,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the integral and frequency methods are mostly used to define reactive power and do not give high accuracy in the calculations of power balance or cannot describe the essence of physical processes. The problem is complicated in DC electric transport systems due to random impulse character of voltages and currents. As a comparison, the calculation of reactive power according to various approaches was performed for the DE1 electric locomotive. It is suggested that the instantaneous reactive power should be used for the analysis of electromagnetic exchange processes in DC power systems. The paper shows the definition and main formulas for defining the instantaneous reactive power taking into consideration the random character of voltage and current. Numerical calculations together with statistical analysis were performed for two variants of experimentally recorded voltages and currents: the first one - on the bus-bar of traction substation, which supplies the section with the Pendolino trains in Poland and the second one - on the current collector of the VL8 electric locomotive in Ukraine.

However, such an analysis is usually performed for steady-state modes and only under the condition that the time realization of voltages and currents, being deterministic for continuous quantities, have infinite length. De facto, the electric transport devices operate in non-stationary dynamic modes (starting up, coasting, acceleration, regenerative braking, stopping, wheel spin, voltage surges, etc.). As a result, the voltage across the traction motors and the current flowing through them are noncontinuous pulsed stochastic processes. It is necessary to add that in emergency modes the voltage and current are short-term single pulses. The paper presents the spectral analysis of such random sequences of pulses as well as their fronts and decays, the concepts of actual and instantaneous spectra. The analytical expressions for amplitudes and the initial phases of k-th harmonics are obtained using the discrete Fourier transformation. The numerical calculations of the spectral composition of stochastic pulse processes of voltage and current were performed for the DE1 and VL8 electric locomotives (Ukraine) as well as for trams operating on the routes of the city of Dnipro.

However, during measurements at changing environmental conditions, the surface of the fiber made of fused silica is subjected to stresses that can cause alterations in its structure. The problem is particularly important when long-term or biosensing measurements are considered and when sensor surface may be exposed to subsequent drying and immersion in aqueous solutions. The aim of this paper was to investigate the influence of sequential drying in air and soaking in water of the fused silica fiber cladding surface on the optical response of LPGs. We demonstrated that transmission spectrum of LPG measured in water before and after drying in air differed significantly and further changed with subsequent drying steps indicating increase of the local RI. All these changes correspond to the alterations in the cladding surface, i.e., its fracturing and pores rearrangement, caused by the stress induced during drying and then immersing in water, as well as possible corrosion and formation of nanosized objects on the cladding surface. The effect can be additionally influenced by washing the samples in organic solvents. We confirmed that measurements done in a flow-cell system, where the sensor was kept wet during the sensing experiment may eliminate the water-induced fiber surface alteration effect and thus minimize the amount of false results.

The challenges in simulation of gas distribution networks are usually that of computational efficiency of the methods due to large dimensionality of the simulated networks, though it can also be related to flexible incorporation of the peripheral equipment (e.g., valves, compressors, pressure, and flow regulators) into the network model. Today, however, new challenges emerge as a consequence of market changes facing the gas industry in a multienergy system environment. These changes are expected to bring about significant fluctuations and uncertainty in distributed gas supply and demand as a consequence of increased gas-to-power activities, and a number of decentralized entry points, where deliveries of both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable gases, such as hydrogen and synthetic methane, can be achieved.

Moreover, instantaneous traffic of each demand is throttled at its originating node accordingly to the current total capacity available on the demand's dedicated tunnels. In effect, the network is always capable of carrying the admitted traffic. In this paper we deal with an efficient, implementable version of FT, referred to as AFT (affine flow thinning). By deriving appropriate cutting-plane and path-generation algorithms, we show how real-life network dimensioning problems for AFT can be efficiently treated using a proper characterization of the network link availability states.

In this study, we focused on laminar, U-shaped accelerations of heart rate - approximately 20-40 seconds long - in the nighttime recordings. Methods: The influence of U-shape accelerations on HRV parameters was evaluated based on night-time 34 RR interval time series obtained from healthy adults. We performed calculations on recordings without top 5% intervals (in terms of RR duration), without bottom 5% intervals and on recordings with randomly shuffled RR intervals. For each recording, the VLF frequency band, Shannon and Sample Entropy, standard deviation, mean, RMSSD, Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA), and symbolic analysis parameters were calculated using signals with and without modifications. Results: U-shape accelerations accounted for 5.3±3.3% of the total recordings duration. There were significant differences between the signals without modification and without the smallest 5% intervals (thus without majority of U-shape periods) of the values of HF, LF and VLF frequency bands power, Shannon and Sample Entropy, standard deviation and symbolic analysis parameters (p<;0.05). We also observed a significant reduction of multifractality using Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA) after removing the U-shape accelerations from the recording. These effects did not occur in the surrogate data with shuffled samples (p<;0.05 was obtained only for symbolic analysis parameters), and in case of the signals with rejected the largest 5% of intervals (p<;0.05 only for symbolic analysis parameters and Shannon entropy). Conclusions: Characteristic U-shape accelerations in nighttime RR time series, despite a short total duration, have a significant influence on the VLF frequency band, multifractality and the complexity of the signal.

The simple model shows wave propagation through nonlinear multilayer grating in an optical way (without the need to use complex methods). A new behavior of output intensity versus input intensity in such a structure has been obtained for the first time. At the beginning, the structure is examined without taking into account the gain and loss saturation. In this case, the characteristics of reflection and transmission coefficients, and eigenvalues of S matrix are obtained as a function of geometrical parameters of Bragg gratings. The characteristics reveal special points, discussed later, where the structure is PT-symmetric or has a broken symmetry phase. In the first case, the amplitudes of both waves, travelling in opposite directions, do not change, which corresponds to the unimodularity of the S matrix eigenvalues. In the other case, the increase of one amplitude forces the decrease of the other one, and the eigenvalues have reciprocal magnitudes. For these points, the systematic study including the gain and loss saturation effects is conducted. The obtained characteristics illustrate the influence of the saturation intensities on the output intensities, reflection and transmission coefficients, and eigenvalues of S matrix for the incident plane wave with a given intensity. The characteristics demonstrate strong nonreciprocal response and the bistable behavior of the structure. Moreover, for certain values of Bragg gratings geometrical parameters, the investigated structure transits from broken symmetry phase to a PT-symmetric one.",1558-1713,,10.1109/JQE.2017.2761380,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063405,Gratings;integrated optics;nonlinear optics,Bragg gratings;Integrated optics;Optical losses;Nonlinear optics,,,,,27,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed method uses virtual electromagnetic torque, which is calculated on the basis of converter current and virtual flux of the power grid. Direct calculation of reference alpha/beta components of current vector does not require any synchronization procedure or grid voltage/virtual flux orientation of the reference frame. On the other hand, the proposed control is still as simple in implementation as other vector control methods such as voltage-oriented control or virtual-flux-oriented control. The introduced variable (virtual torque) allows us to calculate reference current vector components in alpha/beta frame without symmetrical components decomposition. The current vector obtained by using the proposed control method has the same asymmetry factor as unbalanced grid voltage. It means that the rectifier is seen by the grid as a resistive load with the same resistance in each phase. For the grid it is preferable target because the phase with the highest voltage is loaded most, while the other phases are less loaded.

MIMO Receiver with Reduced Number of RF Chains Based on 4D Array and Software Defined Radio,G. Bogdan; K. Godziszewski; Y.

Nevertheless, the capacity gain comes with a cost. In particular, multiple analog radio frequency (RF) chains are required at both the transmitter and the receiver, thereby leading to a higher implementation cost, more power consumption, and lower energy efficiency. This paper presents a receiver with only one RF chain for 2 × 2 MIMO transmission system. Proposed design is based on a time modulated antenna array (TMAA) with beam-steering functionality and a wideband software defined radio (SDR).

The considered attacks take advantage of the statistical network flows' features and application of machine learning (ML) methods and can be utilized by a passive traffic observer. In this perspective, the first part of the research presented in this paper analyzes the feasibility of identifying individual devices in a victim's home network.

In a standard topology the voltage across the input diode becomes very high during the rectifier mode, which causes very high losses and increases cost of the device. Structure of a proposed impedance network is designed to limit the voltage of the capacitors by a factor of two and, in consequence, voltage stress of the input diode is also lower. The modified current-fed quasi Z-source converter connected to the standard grid (3 ×400V RMS) is able to operate with SiC Schottky diodes rated at 1200 V.

Although Hamilton's canonical equations exhibit many advantageous features compared to their acceleration-based counterparts, it appears that there is a lack of dedicated parallel algorithms for multirigid body system dynamics based on this formulation. Serial kinematic chains are considered in this paper. Initially, the standard set of Hamilton's canonical equations is joined together with constraint equations at the velocity level. The reformulation determines the system's joint velocities and constraint force impulses in a divide and conquer manner resulting in logarithmic numerical cost for parallel implementation. Subsequently, the equations of motion are rearranged in order to obtain the time derivatives of the total joint momenta. In the case of the sequential implementation, the entire algorithm exhibits linear computational cost. Presented numerical method is exact and noniterative. Numerical test cases reveal negligible energy drift without the use of any additional constraint stabilization techniques.

The objective of the presented study was to apply a statistical modelling of the nocturnal atmospheric UHI based on the relationship between observed air temperature from ground stations and remotely-sensed temperature of the urban surface. The goal of the approach was to limit input data for the developed modelling method in order to assure transferability of the methodology to different cities. Time series of surface temperature and NDVI were obtained from the MODIS instrument for a 10 year period (2008-2017). The air temperature was collected from the in-situ observational network of 21 stations. The study was conducted for different locations with gradual changes in urbanization in order to assess the impact of urbanization on the relationship between simultaneous air and surface UHI. The urbanization was described by commonly available land cover metrics. Results showed that the proposed approach provided satisfactory AUHI modelling results for the locations with the least degree of urbanization. The best results were obtained with a simple linear regression model with the iterative procedure to minimize the mean absolute gross error (MAGE). The lowest MAGE for modelled UHI was 1.18°C with 69% of the variance explained. The strongest linear relationship between simultaneous SUHI and AUHI was noted for those station pairs which their surroundings have the highest differences in urbanization, and the highest UHI intensities observed.

The genesis and structure of crime, its intensity, and dynamics are subjects of intense scientific studies carried out by researchers in various fields of science. Increasing possibilities to track crime events give public organizations and police departments the opportunity to collect and store detailed data, including spatial and temporal information. At the same time, the crowd-sourced open datasets as social media and Internet datasets can be a valuable source of knowledge about various behavior patterns and social phenomena, including those of criminal nature. Thus, exploratory analysis and data mining become an important part of the current methodology for the detection and forecasting of crime development. The ability to use data analysis tools to extract useful information related to criminal events enables law enforcement agencies to more efficiently allocate their resources to specific crime areas. It allows the effective deployment of officers to high-risk crime areas and elimination from areas with a decreasing crime trend as well as developing effective crime prevention strategies. The purpose of this paper is to show the usefulness of analytic algorithms in predicting crimes, however, there are other applications of such analyzes in the area of law enforcement, such as defining criminal hot spots, creating criminal profiles, and detecting crime trends. The most important factor is the accuracy with which one can infer and create new knowledge based on observations from the past that will be useful in the process of reducing the number of crimes (predictive policing) and ensure the security of citizens.",,978-1-5386-7834-3,10.1109/ICSENG.2018.8638179,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8638179,crime prediction;time series;generalized additive model;nonlinear regression;Prophet forecasting model;ARIMA,Predictive models;Forecasting;Data mining;Market research;Law enforcement;Analytical models;Time series analysis,criminal law;data analysis;data mining;Internet;police;police data processing;time series,behavior patterns;social phenomena;criminal nature;exploratory analysis;data mining;crime development;data analysis tools;criminal events;law enforcement agencies;specific crime areas;high-risk crime areas;criminal profiles;time series analysis;crime forecasting;technological development;human life;intense scientific studies;crime events;public organizations;police departments;detailed data;spatial information;temporal information;crowd-sourced open datasets;social media;Internet datasets;crime trends;criminal hot spots;crime prevention strategies,,,40,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking into consideration the DC microgrid the power balance and DC voltage level is normally provided by hybrid energy storage system. However the battery capacity is limited and then the additional processes have to be conducted to keep the power balance. The advanced power management algorithm has to considered the communication infrastructure in the microgrid but it also should provide proper power sharing when the communication is corrupted. From the other hand, the power electronics converters connected to the DC microgrid (a smart transformer DC link sub-circuits, RESs or constant power loads) should work with a nominal DC voltage level. Therefore, it should be kept by the control system as long as possible.

In this context, it is usually assumed that energy purchased within a (long-term) contract will be cheaper than energy purchased from the market (whenever needed). Hence, over-use of energy (going over the energy consumption limit, established in the contract), will result in purchase of additional energy and thus should be avoided. In this context, let us also assume that, in a smart home, devices are turned on and off by a centralized control mechanism. Furthermore, individual households can express preferences when each of their devices is to be used. In this case, the question that needs to be answered is: how to schedule devices in a way that will be satisfactory to the users (households) and match the parameters of the contract. The aim of this text is to describe an agent system that was developed to schedule device operation according to the contract-imposed limitations.

The sensor is fabricated by femtosecond laser in a single-mode fiber. A cylindrical cavity is micromachined in the fiber cladding and partly in the fiber core, forming an interferometric structure. We have found that when the spectral response of the structure to RI is considered, a periodic pattern is observed and the sensitivity highly increases with RI and reaches over 23 000 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.4200-1.4400 RIU. Moreover, during the measurement of cavities with diameters in the order of tens of micrometers, we found the cavity-filling process to be both difficult and time-consuming, especially when high-RI liquids are being investigated. We therefore applied reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, which significantly changed the wettability of the cavity's surface and enabled fast cavity filling with any investigated liquid.

However, for data transmission over a longer distance, dispersion in multi-mode fiber limits the performance. To achieve high data rates at a distance above 1 km VCSELs with narrow optical spectrum can be used. Oxide-confined VCSELs can be engineered in a way to increase leakage of the high order transverse optical modes thus promoting single-mode operation. Such leaky single-mode VCSELs experience smaller dispersion and hence allow transmission over longer distances. Important feature of the leaky design is the leakage of high order modes through the second cavity of the VCSEL. This effect can be used for lateral integration to photo-diodes or waveguides. In this paper, we demonstrate high speed transmission at 25 Gbit/s up to 1 km of OM4 multimode fiber using 850 nm leaky VCSELs.

They are designed to be used in power electronic converters, such as grid-tie converters or constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) true sine wave inverters, as well as in motion control systems, especially in assembly line robots. The proposed control algorithms combine the good responsiveness of the classic deterministic iterative learning controller (ILC) with the robustness offered by the evolutionary population-based swarm controller. Properties of the control algorithms are illustrated in the CACF inverter using computer simulations. One out of the schemes is then employed in the three-phase grid-tie converter to facilitate sinusoidal currents under the distorted grid voltage conditions. A weakness not manifested in the case of the CACF inverter, however clearly apparent in the case of the grid-tie converter if envisaged to interface a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), is identified. The concept of an adaptive evaporation rate for the PSRC is then investigated to enhance the performance of the original hybrid repetitive controller.

Nevertheless, the problems that designers face when approaching these systems-of-systems are still eclipsed by the heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-level complexity of those. In spite of the many underlying technological challenges, how to optimally architect distributed satellite systems, remains an open source of debate. In this context, this paper presents a design-oriented methodology that is aimed at providing high-level design solutions for this type of architectures in generic EO use-cases. In order to find optimal solutions, the methodology detailed in this paper is grounded on an aggregated architectural figure-of-merit that compresses: (a) system-level performance metrics; (b) use-case requirements; (c) development and launch costs; and (d) a set of architectural quality attributes. The latter contributing term models, assesses and weights several of the so-called “ilities” of an architecture and allows to select designs that exhibit some desired qualities. With a dimensionality of more than five thousand architectural alternatives, the study has been illustrated with a marine weather forecast use-case. Both the exploration of design alternatives and the analysis of the results have shown the benefits of medium and small satellite platforms and have stressed their potential in the design of distributed satellite systems. Finally, this paper concludes by suggesting that this very optimization framework and methodology could also be used for a quantitative gap analysis aiming at deriving the technological road map for future engineering teams.",,978-1-5386-2014-4,10.1109/AERO.2018.8396712,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396712,,Computer architecture;Instruments;Space vehicles;Satellites;Measurement;Optimization;Computational modeling,artificial satellites;geophysical equipment,satellite platforms;satellite architectures;high-level design solutions;system-level performance metrics;distributed satellite systems;optimized model-based design space exploration;multiorbit multiplatform Earth observation spacecraft;Earth observation services,,3,24,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to evaluate its effect to nonlinear properties of HRV considering the ageing. Night-time 63 RR interval series from healthy subjects (26 males, 39 females, mean age: 40±14y) collected from the Institute of Cardiology and the Medical University of Gdańsk were analysed. Nonlinear properties of HRV were described by using DFA, Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA) and Sample entropy.

Research in the field of floodlighting has also focused on other aspects of this type of lighting in recent years. The energy efficiency issue and the impact on light pollution are the most crucial aspects. These issues have not yet been properly explored in the literature. Significant factors which affect the issue of the engineering aspect of floodlighting have to be determined and studied carefully because of their high importance. The main aim of this paper is to present the key factors which have a crucial impact on energy efficiency and light pollution in the field of floodlighting. These factors are: the direction and location of the lighting equipment, luminous intensity distribution, light output ratio, the method of floodlighting and the spectral power distribution of a light source, as well as the spectral distribution of the reflectance from the illuminated surface. Each of these factors are precisely commented on. These are presented by means of a calculation, a measurement or a visualization example, which clearly allow the crux of the problem to be analysed in the easiest way. The research shows that the problem of improving floodlighting design in respect of energy efficiency and light pollution is a complex and exacting problem for a lighting designer. It definitely requires the creation of an individual and unified system of assessment. It ought to take into account all the crucial factors and be simple, understandable and easy to use.

Per Unit Approach Based Assessment of Torque Production Capability of PMSMs Operating in the Field Weakening Region,M. Gierczynski; L. Grzesiak,"Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2019 Fourteenth International Conference on Ecological Vehicles and Renewable Energies (EVER),,2019,,,1,15,"The permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is a frequent choice for battery electric vehicle (BEV) traction purposes. In order to cover torque demand of common drive cycles with single gear transmission, a very wide field weakening operation range is necessary. This paper introduces a modified per unit system description, which takes advantage of a novel definition of base quantities. The presented method allows easy assessment of PMSM drive torque curve shape in the field weakening region based on only two variables, i.e., the drive characteristic factor and the electrical machine saliency factor. These two factors are also sufficient to describe all qualitatively different torque vs. speed curve shapes, which can be achieved using PMSM variable speed drives. It is a well known fact that the motor power factor affects inverter power rating and its current demand. The presented approach links this dependency with a particular qualitative drive torque vs. speed curve shape. It allows further to predict machine equivalent circuit parameters and the inverter power rating for every feasible torque vs. speed curve shape meeting particular application requirements. This method provides then an analytical basis for preliminary system design and dimensioning.",,978-1-7281-3703-2,10.1109/EVER.2019.8813512,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813512,permanent magnet synchronous motor;field weakening;torque curve;motor saliency,,battery powered vehicles;electric vehicle charging;equivalent circuits;gears;invertors;permanent magnet motors;power factor;synchronous motor drives;torque;variable speed drives,torque production capability;field weakening region;permanent magnet synchronous motor;torque demand;single gear transmission;PMSM drive torque curve shape;PMSM variable speed drives;motor power factor;inverter power rating;current demand;machine equivalent circuit parameters;battery electric vehicle traction;BEV traction,,,24,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike in other types of networks, in radio-based wireless mesh networks, the link capacities depend not only on the prevailing conditions, but also on interfering transmissions, as well as the transmission power and modulation and coding schemes used. This leads to increased difficulty in modelling and mitigating partial link failures, such as those caused by unfavourable weather. In this paper we present optimisation models for reconfiguration of routing and traffic demand volumes in wireless mesh networks, taking into account transmission power and modulation and coding schemes.

However, the performance of digital relays depends on many factors and needs to be carefully evaluated. These factors may be caused correct operations with less performance or completely incorrect operations. Frequency deviation is one of those factors which results from unbalanced demand load and generation levels. Load characteristics and generation control response to demand load changes will effect on amount and duration of frequency deviations. Frequency decreases when demand load is higher than generation, whereas, it increases when load is less than generation. Protection relays are provided with frequency tracking to reduce the effects of frequency deviations on accuracy of relays decisions. In this paper traditional frequency tracking technique used on protection relays is modified to give a better performance during off-nominal frequency variations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with traditional tracking using Least Square Error (LSQ), and Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm without any tracking, which are investigated in MATLAB environment.",,978-1-5090-5795-5,10.1109/INISTA.2017.8001159,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001159,Numerical Relays;Frequency Deviation;Phasor Estimation;Digital Signal Processing,Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Relays;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Power harmonic filters;Mathematical model,adaptive estimation;relay protection,off-nominal frequency variations;frequency tracking;digital multifunction protection relays;adaptive phasor estimation technique,,1,22,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of the waveguiding core increases the oscillator strength of the VCSEL mode, allows the ultimate optical confinement (“λ/2 design”) and reduces dramatically the optical power accumulated in the VCSEL mesa in the regions outside of the oxide aperture. We consider basic differences of conventional and antiwaveguiding VCSEL and address optical modes in the device. Both Joule heat and heat generated by the free carrier absorption of the optical mode in the doped semiconductor layers and their impact on the refractive index profile are considered. We show that for typical regimes of the VCSEL design and operation absorption-induced heat exceeds by several times the Joule heat while the shape of the generated heated domains strongly differ. Modeling shows that current increase results in an increase in spectral separation of the fundamental and high-order transverse optical modes. Selection of the fundamental mode persists upon increase in injection current up to 10 mA at 5 μm aperture diameter.

For comparison two LPGs, namely one before and after the nanocoating process were optimized towards working at dispersion turning point (DTP) of higher order cladding modes. The DTP was reached with two methods, i.e., by wet etching of LPG's cladding and by optimized deposition of Al2O3 thin overlay using atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. For both the cases we show significant increase in RI sensitivity at DTP. When Al2O3 is deposited the RI sensitivity reaches 9270 nm/RIU for traced only one resonance out of the pair and RI in range 1.33-1.34 RIU, what is over 4-fold higher than for the bare LPG. Moreover, T sensitivity for both the structures was compared and the one for Al2O3-coated sample was found to be only up to 12% higher than for the bare sample. Higher RI sensitivity and low temperature cross-sensitivity effects allow for more accurate RI measurements than in case of bare LPGs. The Al2O3-nanocoated LPGs can further find applications in label-free biosensing, due to their optimized sensitivity in RI in range close that of water.",,978-1-5090-4850-2,10.1117/12.2267635,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961094,optical fiber sensor;long-period grating (LPG);dispersion turning point (DTP);thin film;aluminum oxide (Al2O3);atomic layer deposition (ALD);refractive index sensing;temperature sensing,Sensitivity;Aluminum oxide;Coatings;Temperature sensors;Refractive index;Gratings;Optical fiber sensors,aluminium compounds;antireflection coatings;atomic layer deposition;diffraction gratings;etching;fibre optic sensors;nanophotonics;optical fibre cladding;optical fibre dispersion;optical films;refractive index measurement,refractive index sensing;nanocoated long period gratings;dispersion turning point;temperature cross-sensitivity;LPG;refractive index sensitivity;nanocoating;DTP;higher order cladding modes;wet etching;atomic layer deposition;ALD;resonance;label-free biosensing;Al2O3,,,17,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Model predictive control for variable stiffness elasticity actuator,M. Szumowski; M.

Robots that will work with people in the future will be an increasingly common image not only in factories but also in our homes. This goal creates a challenge for engineers and scientists. This challenge is not only to develop safe and reliable mechanical design and control systems that will provide high quality of performed task but also to create safe systems for interacting with human being. One of the possible solution for it is to integrate into structure of robot so called elastic actuators instead of classic stiff actuators. Increasing popularity of elastic actuators results from the fact that those actuators have many positive attributes in relation to classic stiff actuators. Such features are: increased shock tolerance, easier positional control in the contact issues, easier force control (which can be directly reduced to a position control problem) or high back driveability (used in tele-manipulation process or programing by hand in robotic arms). In this paper we present a position control method for Variable Stiffness Elasticity Actuator. To achieve this goal, we modelled such actuator using discrete state-space approach, first. Parameters of model used in simulations were defined with use of prototype concept of this actuator. Control method utilizes a Model Predictive Control approach to calculate input to the DC motor. Using Model Predictive Control approach we optimize changes of control variable along prediction horizon. We also present a method on how to select stiffness of the system while taking into account maximum possible values of physical spring. In our paper we present simulation of three possible types of input: step function, smooth velocity step function and sinusoidal function.

The method allows us to forecast the trajectories of nominally possible motion goals (prognosing of an action). The probability functions support the selection of possible motion goal. Then the possible motion trajectory is created which predicts the ongoing action.

The described method enables to calculate the resonant frequencies of an electrically long Fabry-Pérot cavity and to link them to particular propagating (transverse) modes of the waveguide. It also allows to easily analyze the origin of losses in the structure including the volumetric losses within the dielectric ridge as well as the nonideal and frequency dependent behavior of mirrors and/or antennas that terminate the waveguide for an improved coupling to the free space.

Investigations were focused on Au/Sn intermetallic compounds formed at the interface between Au metallization on the chip and Sn metallization on the DBC (Direct Bonded Copper) substrate. Two version of SLID were applied: one stage process at 350°C and two stage process short time at 280 °C + long time at 180°C. Second process is divided into two steps: short high temperature (280°C) step for melting Sn and initial intermetallic compound formation and long low temperature (180°C) step for solid state diffusion process. Design of experiments technique was used for process optimization. The best process parameters were obtained and they were applied for monocrystalline GaN chips assembly to DBC substrates. In the long-term stability tests at 300°C it was proven that both versions of investigated SLID technique can be applied for monocrystalline GaN chips assembly.

Yet Another Network Steganography Technique Basedon TCP Retransmissions,A. M. Brodzki; J.

The method can use any user-generated network traffic as hidden transmission channel. It utilizes overwriting TCP segments payload without recalculating checksums. Therefore, a segment after reaching its target is considered incorrect and it can be taken over to extract hidden data. Despite that, the segment is normally retransmitted according to the protocol specification; thanks to this, normal user communication is not affected. Following this idea, the basic mechanisms of this technique were designed and implemented. The testbed environment was prepared to conduct the initial proof-of-concept experiments and to measure basic operational metrics. The average steganographic bandwidth at the level of 2 kB/s was achieved for the conditions ensuring the proper level of undetectability.

On cycle based schedulers with time alternating priorities,W. Burakowski; M. Sosnowski,"Institute of Telecommunications, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Telecommunications, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC),,2017,,,1,6,"The paper discusses new scheduling algorithms that are modifications of classical cycle based scheme, named the cycle based algorithm with time alternating priorities and time guard. The classical cycle based algorithm assumes that a given packet stream can be served only in predefined periods while it is not entitled to receive service in the periods dedicated to serve other packet streams. This property leads to non-work conserving behavior of the system and, as a consequence, rather poor packet transfer characteristics (expressed by packet delay and packet loss ratio in the case of system with a finite buffer). On the other hand, the important advantage of this algorithm is that it guarantees performance isolation among different packet streams. The proposed modification assumes that in the periods dedicated for service of a given packet stream the scheduler can also serve the packets belonging to other streams but with assigned lower priorities. In this way we transform the behavior of the cycle based algorithm to the form of nearly work conserving. In the paper we provide exemplary simulation results showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of packet delay characteristics and guarantees about performance isolation. Finally, we show the application of the studied scheme to the IIP System with virtualized network infrastructure requiring isolation among virtual links sharing a given link capacity.",2474-154X,978-1-5090-6796-1,10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215377,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215377,scheduling scheme;cycle based scheduler with alternating priorities;performance isolation;virtualized network infrastructure;virtual links;simulation results,Delays;Simulation;Scheduling algorithms;Time division multiple access;Servers;Transforms,computer networks;quality of service;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation,cycle based schedulers;scheduling algorithms;classical cycle based scheme;link capacity;virtual link sharing;virtualized network infrastructure r;IIP system;packet transfer characteristics;packet streams;packet delay characteristics;packet loss ratio;time guard,,,7,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

These residual errors are caused by an asymmetry of a thru/line standard and a load mismatch. To remove errors of the first type, we introduce a novel simple technique of the thru/line symmetrization, which utilizes an additional measurement of the same standard, but reversely connected to the VNA ports. To extract the load mismatch errors, we apply the multiline TRL (Thru-Reflect-Line) calibration as a reference one. To this end we use three common barrels of different lengths acting after their symmetrization as transmission line standards. With the VNA calibrated using the multiline TRL method, we characterize our mismatched load and then utilize its data to our modified TRM calibration. We show that this simple and low-cost approach results in improved accuracy of the TRM calibration.

Sound Level Control Based on Grey System Theory for Protection Against Hearing Damage Risk in Music Entertainment Venues,G. Makarewicz; M.

As communication medium and source of aesthetic experience., music is not usually associated with noise - a term denoting an unwanted, annoying sound - therefore the sound levels of music are not monitored in most venues. As a result, both the personnel and the audience are often exposed to sound levels from loudspeakers or headphones that pose a high risk of hearing damage. In this paper we propose a solution intended to reduce the risk of hearing damage by predicting the daily noise exposure level (LEX, 8 h) and automatically limiting the level of reproduced sound.

The small surface and the relatively simple structure have a controversial effect. In a positive way, these features provide faster processing compared to face detection and make detection easier compared to fingerprints. On the other side, like other biometrics, current ear biometric recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks. A spoofing attack occurs at sensor level and every impostor can masquerade as someone else by altering data, thus, obtaining an illegitimate access. Due to a lack of anti-spoofing databases, that would support this paper, ear fake databases have been built using different mobile phones. In this paper, an ear presentation attack detection database is collected which contains a various range of variations of potential attacks. In particular, the database consists of two main parts, a) AMI dataset which has 700 ear images and we make display attack by using them, b) data collected at University of Tabriz containing 20 genuine subjects and fake ears which are made from the genuine ears. Different mobile phones are used for collecting the database. Three fake ear attacks are implemented which include video attack, printed attack, and display attack. Consequently, for each subject, 2 videos (left and right ears), 8 different images, and the final database contain 10 video clips and 160 images are prepared.

Due to the strong effect of pH of the environment on the analyte properties, we utilized buffer solutions of various pH during all experiments.

Thanks to their feature: two electrically symmetric gates, there is a possibility to greatly reduce the number of elements required to build digital circuits. The use of complementary pair of twin-gate VeSFETs enables to design two-input NOR or NAND cell composed of two instead of four transistors. The combination of the key device parameters: slit width and dopants concentration as well as gate oxide thickness have been established in order to obtain both OR and AND functionality in a single transistor, providing the best distinguishability of the logic states. In particular, we have confirmed that control of the same single bulk channel of VeSFET by two gates ensures to achieve very high drain current ratio (up to le6) corresponding to “11” and “10” input states in the case of the transistor of AND functionality, which is unattainable in other known technologies.",,978-83-63578-14-5,10.23919/MIXDES.2018.8436648,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8436648,VeSTIC;VeSFET;circuit area saving;NAND logic cell;AND/OR transistor functionality,Ions;Logic gates;Integrated circuits;Substrates;Doping,circuit optimisation;field effect logic circuits;field effect transistor circuits;logic design;NAND circuits,logic states;VeSTIC technology;Vertical Slit Transistor-based Integrated Circuit;junction-less VeSFET devices;Vertical-Slit Field-Effect Transistor;electrically symmetric gates;digital circuits;NAND cell;gate oxide thickness;logic cells;twin-gate VeSFET;OR functionality;AND functionality;NOR cell,,,19,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,
An optimization model for affine flow thinning — A traffic protection mechanism for FSO networks,M. Pióro; I. Kalesnikau; M.

In FT, end-to-end traffic demands are equipped with dedicated logical tunnels (for example MPLS tunnels) whose maximal capacity is subject to thinning in order to follow the fluctuations of the currently available link capacity. It follows that for each demand the instantaneous traffic realized between its end nodes must accommodate to the current total capacity available on its dedicated tunnels. In the paper we develop an optimization model for network dimensioning for a potentially implementable variant of FT, the so called General Affine Flow Thinning (GAFT), and present a solution algorithm based on the path generation approach. We derive a relevant pricing problem and present a numerical study that illustrates efficiency of the optimization algorithm, as well as compares the network cost for different variants of the flow thinning mechanism.",,978-1-5386-0671-1,10.1109/RNDM.2017.8093015,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093015,Survivable networks;variable link capacity;linear and mixed-integer programming;multicommodity flows;affine routing;path generation,Optimization;Numerical models;Pricing;1/f noise;Communication networks;Wireless networks;Multiprotocol label switching,affine transforms;free-space optical communication;multiprotocol label switching;optimisation;pricing;telecommunication traffic,flow thinning mechanism;optimization model;FSO networks;active traffic protection mechanism;end-to-end traffic demands;dedicated logical tunnels;currently available link capacity;end nodes;current total capacity;network dimensioning;optimization algorithm;network cost;MPLS tunnels;instantaneous traffic;General Affine Flow Thinning;path generation approach,,1,13,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

To demonstrate effectiveness of the discussed algorithms, two emulated benchmark processes and a laboratory servo are considered. The influence of some tuning parameters on algorithms' calculation time is studied. It is shown that for short sampling periods the classical DMC and GPC algorithms fail to work since calculations last longer than the sampling period, which is unacceptable.

Nowadays, the distributed generation systems consist of many renewable energy sources (RESs) and active loads, connected to the grid by the power electronics converters (PECs). As a result, more often the PECs with novel functionalities like harmonic elimination, voltage sags compensation, grid stability improvement etc. are required. One of the promising solutions for distributed generation system, which allows improve the delivered power is a smart transformer (ST). It is able to replace the classical MV/LV transformer, where additional functionalities are necessary to provide the higher energy quality. Additionally, the ST is characterized by lower weight/volume and provides easy integration of AC and DC sub-grids. Therefore, in this paper, the modelling problem of a modern MV grid with classical and smart transformers have been described. Moreover, the comprehensive simulation analysis of the MV grid was performed, in which different functionalities of ST were considered.

FSO is a well established wireless optical transmission technology considered as an alternative to radio communications for example in metropolitan wireless mesh networks. An FSO link is established by means of a laser beam between the transmitter and the receiver placed in the line of sight. A major disadvantage of FSO links (with respect to fiber links) is their sensitivity to weather conditions such as fog, rain and snow, causing substantial loss of the optical transmission power over the channel due mostly to absorption and scattering. Although the FSO technology allows for a fast and low-cost deployment of broadband networks, its operation will be affected by vulnerability of the link transmissions to weather conditions that can be manifested by substantial losses in links' transmission capacity with respect to the nominal capacity. Therefore, proper dimensioning of an FSO network should take such losses into account so that the level of carried traffic is satisfactory under all observed weather conditions. In the paper we introduce and study an optimization problem for such enhanced dimensioning using the robust optimization approach.",,978-1-5386-0671-1,10.1109/RNDM.2017.8093027,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093027,,Meteorology;Robustness;Optimization;Optical transmitters;Modulation;Optical fiber communication;Uncertainty,broadband networks;free-space optical communication;optimisation,optical transmission power;FSO technology;broadband networks;link transmissions;observed weather conditions;robust FSO network dimensioning;Free Space Optics communications;metropolitan wireless mesh networks;FSO link;carried traffic;wireless optical transmission technology;optimization problem,,3,26,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

"Who should bid higher, NS or WE, in a given Bridge dealƒ",J. Mańdziuk; J. Suchan,"Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland; Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),,2019,,,1,8,"The paper proposes a neural model for a direct comparison of the two so-called Double Dummy Bridge Problem (DDBP) instances, along with a practical use-case for determining which pair, NS or WE, should propose the higher deal during a bidding phase in a Bridge game. The proposed system is composed of two identical subnetworks combined by a comparator layer placed on top of them. The base of each subnetwork is a shallow autoencoder (AE) which is further connected with a Multilayer Perceptron. The system is trained in two phases - an unsupervised one - used to create a meaningful feature-based input representation in AE compression layer, and a supervised one - meant for fine-tuning of the whole model. Training and test data are composed of pairs of Bridge deals in which the second deal in a pair is the first one rotated by 90 degrees. Since the task is to point which of the two deals promise a higher contract for the NS pair, due to deal rotation within a pair, the system effectively answers the title question ""Who should bid higher, NS or WE, in a given deal?"". The proposed approach is experimentally compared with two other methods: one relying on a neural system solving the DDBP and the other one employing several estimators of hand strength used by experienced players.

The concept of this approach called (FSIFT: Fractional-SIFT) is inspired by the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) proposed by Lowe and can be viewed as a certain generalization of this formula. The classical SIFT detector is implemented efficiently by using a difference of Gaussian (DoG) functions applied to image, in order to identify potential interest points. This difference is an approximation of the LoG (Laplacian of Gaussians) operator, which can be treated as the sum of the second order derivatives of the Gaussian image. In our method we take advantage of the fractional order derivative performed on the Gaussian images. In order to extract distinctive invariant features we have omitted the step of calculating DoG images. Instead of it, we have applied the fractional derivatives of different orders not far from the values of two. We have chosen the robust and efficient method of calculating the fractional order derivative using the Fourier domain. Many practical experiments have been performed. The promising results of our approach have been compared with the results of application of the well known algorithms like SURF and SIFT.",2326-0319,978-83-62065-30-1,10.23919/SPA.2017.8166891,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8166891,,Fourier transforms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Dogs;Approximation algorithms;Robustness,approximation theory;feature extraction;transforms,fractional order derivative;Fractional order method;image keypoints detection;characteristic image point detection;Fractional-SIFT;Scale-Invariant Feature Transform;classical SIFT detector;Gaussian image;DoG images;robust method;second order derivatives;FSIFT;difference of Gaussian functions;Laplacian of Gaussians operator;distinctive invariant features;Fourier domain,,1,17,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,
A Model for Estimating the Blood Flow of the POLVAD Pulsatile Ventricular Assist Device,A. Siewnicka; K. Janiszowski,"Institute of Automatic Control and Robotics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Automatic Control and Robotics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,2018,65,11,2552,2559,"Objective: The aim of this work was to model the blood flow rate of the POLVAD-MEV pulsatile ventricular assist device (VAD). An adequate flow rate is crucial to restore physiological cardiac output. Unfortunately, during clinical heart support, neither blood flows nor pressures can be measured within the device. In general, the flow rate depends on the control parameters and patient conditions. However, the patient's hemodynamic parameters are not constantly monitored. Therefore, blood flow should be evaluated based on the standard measurements from the device control unit. Methods: The model identification data were taken from a research stand consisting of a VAD connected to a hybrid cardiovascular simulator. The studies were conducted under different work and control conditions. A compound model of a ventricular assist device was proposed. First, the driving pressure waveform for an idle run of the supply unit is modeled. Next, the blood flow is estimated based on the difference between the measured value of driving pressure and the modeled value for an idle run. Results: The quality of the developed model is good (R̅2̅ = 0.92) and similar for all tested cases, confirming the high versatility of the proposed solution. Conclusion: The blood flow rate is estimated based on standard signals from the device control unit; therefore, no additional measurements are necessary. Significance: The developed model application in the VAD control unit will aid the selection of control parameters and might be useful for the development of the adaptive control system.

However, even nowadays researchers often struggle to effectively model diffusion processes in heterogeneous, complex media, where the most notable example can be fractal structures. The problem can become even more difficult for time-varying non-homogeneous media. Previous researches have shown that variable-order fractional calculus can be extremely useful in this particular area. Using such mathematical methods allows us to consider investigated medium as the homogeneous non-integer order structure, what can greatly decrease computational time without significant loss of accuracy. In the paper a non-integer variable-order model for heat diffusion in 2-dimensional fractal-like structure is presented. The paper addresses the relations between system order and number of iterations of fractal. Various types of order switching methods are investigated.

Double-gate (DG) and single-gate (SG) transistor structures are considered, and effects of the silicon body thickness and the gate-source overlap are investigated. The differently defined tunneling paths lead to significantly different on currents.

The data gathered during these missions helped to evaluate the basic concept of an airborne vertical electric aerial for Very Low Frequency range; it showed that very long aerials may induce electric charge flow when passing through the cloud layer, need additional weight at their ends to assure safe descent and, when composed of a tape-like structure, automatically move in a helical way, which, with a sufficient antenna length, may in the future enable the design of an elliptically-polarized vertical VLF antenna.

Offset-reflect standards consist of sections of the same uniform transmission line with different lengths, which are terminated with the same highly reflective load. The unknown propagation constant of the transmission line and the load reflection coefficient are then determined simultaneously with the VNA calibration coefficients. We compare our method with the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) method and show that both methods yield similar results. Our new multireflect-thru method is solely based upon dimensional parameters of the calibration standards. Therefore, like the multiline TRL method, it can be used to establish a traceable VNA calibration. Thus, the multireflect-thru method constitutes an alternative to the multiline TRL calibration in environments in which the use of transmission lines is troublesome, such as in the case of VNAs with very small coaxial and waveguide connectors. The multireflect-thru method is also useful in on-wafer measurements since it allows us to keep a constant distance between the probes, which reduces the impact of crosstalk and speeds up automated testing.",1557-9670,,10.1109/TMTT.2016.2627036,Polish National Science Center; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801913,Calibration;error analysis;offset reflects;redundancy;vector network analyzer (VNA),Calibration;Standards;Transmission line measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Power transmission lines;Optimization,calibration;high-frequency transmission lines;network analysers,multireflect-thru method;two-port vector network analyzer calibration;multiple offset-reflect standards;flush thru connection;propagation constant;transmission line;load reflection coefficient;coaxial connectors;waveguide connectors;on-wafer measurements;crosstalk;automated testing,,10,23,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Reducing the costs of FTTH networks by optimized splitter and OLT card deployment,M. Żotkiewicz; M.

We assume that the most tedious part of FTTH network deployment, i.e., trenching and cable installation, is completed, and the operator can start to connect customers to the network. The connecting process still requires expenditures for both passive (splitters) and active (ONUs, OLT cards) equipment. In this paper, we define the problem of rational splitter and OLT card deployment and present the multi-state optimization (MuSO) approach to handle it. MuSO minimizes the expected total cost of deployment using a stochastic model; thus, it optimizes under stochastic behavior. Finally, we compare MuSO to other rational methods, numerically validating its efficiency. We also investigate the impact of various factors-e.g., the take-up rates assumed when designing a network, delays in providing service to newly acquired customers, optimization time limits-on the final FTTH network deployment cost.

The paper focuses on comparison of the adaptive algorithms (LMS, RLS) and the notch filter. The comparison is based on the dedicated measures allowing to assess the distortions (related to loss of information) introduced by the analysed methods both in the whole EEG signal and in the gamma waves band.

The first stage is based on a novel chaotic circuit, which utilizes time as a continuous random variable in a feedback loop. The second stage is based on metastability; however, in contrast to known digital solutions, a flip-flop is stimulated by chaotic initial conditions. The advantage of chaotic behavior is the circuit's immunity to active injection side-channel attacks (e.g., a frequency attack). The circuit design parameters can also vary in a wide range, which makes the TRNG insensitive to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions and tolerance. Moreover, the design is extremely simplified, and therefore, feasible to implement in simple and inexpensive reprogrammable devices (no digital clock manager, programmable delay line, or phase locked loop are required). The TRNG ensures a constant (synchronous) 1-Mb/s bit rate output without additional post-processing. The randomness tests prove a high quality of an output bit stream, which is relatively high when compared with other solutions based on similar hardware resources.",1558-0806,,10.1109/TCSI.2017.2751144,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051063,TRNG;randomness;metastability;chaotic circuit;CPLD;FPGA;programmable devices;ring-oscillator;resolve time;flip-flop;side-channel attacks;frequency attack;NIST tests,Integrated circuit modeling;Chaotic communication;Hardware;Generators;Random variables;Ring oscillators;Mathematical model,chaos;circuit stability;flip-flops;random number generation,random chaotic source;chaotic circuit;feedback loop;chaotic initial conditions;circuit design parameters;true random number generator;flip-flop resolve time instability;TRNG insensitivity;metastability,,4,42,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Although FSO links realize broadband transmission at low cost, their drawback is sensitivity to adverse weather conditions causing transmission degradation on multiple links. Hence, designing such FSO networks requires an optimization model to find the cheapest configuration of link capacities that will be able to carry an acceptable level of the demanded traffic in all weather states that can be foreseen in network operation. Such a model can be achieved using robust optimization techniques, and for that it is important to find a tractable way of characterizing possible link (capacity) degradation states corresponding to weather conditions not known in advance. In the paper we show how weather records can be translated to vectors of link capacity available (after degradation) in particular weather states, and how the resulting link degradation states may be represented mathematically in a compact and tractable way to be exploited in optimization. To solve the second task we will make use of a generalization of a combinatorial problem of finding a minimum hitting set to deduce a compact set approximating a given set of link degradation states. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our model by means of a numerical study.",2576-3539,978-1-7281-4698-0,10.1109/RNDM48015.2019.8949155,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949155,free space optics;wireless mesh networks;robust optimization;uncertainty sets;hitting sets,,combinatorial mathematics;free-space optical communication;optimisation;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;wireless mesh networks,transmission degradation;FSO links;weather phenomena;WMN optimization;wireless mesh networks;free space optics;broadband transmission;adverse weather conditions;FSO networks;link capacity;robust optimization;weather records;weather states;link degradation states;combinatorial problem,,,14,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

DeepIQ is able to learn the underlying principles of solving RMs (the importance of similarity of figures in shape, rotation, size or shading) in a domain-independent way, that allows its subsequent application to test instances constructed based on a different set of figures, never seen before, or another type of IQ problem, with no requirement for additional training. This transfer learning property is of paramount importance due to scarce availability of the real data, and is demonstrated in the paper on two different RM data sets, as well as two distinct types of IQ tasks (solving RMs and odd-one-out problems).

The analysis of changes in the angular positions and in the relative velocities of the vehicles during their right-angle collision was undertaken to determine the initial values necessary for the modelling of the post-impact phase of the vehicle motion (after the end of the vehicle contact phase).

The new architecture has several advantages such as a simple structure and driving system, high and stable repetition rate, which can reach some kilohertz, a very short rising time of a few nanoseconds, a very high gain and efficiency. The present generator doesn't need a high voltage supply - just a tens of volts input suffices to produce a several-kV voltage pulse, what makes this architecture adequate for embedded applications.

In this work, we developed a binary classifier to determine if ICP is above the clinical cutoff value of 20 mmHg. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) recordings serve as the only inputs to the classifier. We identified eighteen ABP and CBFV features reported to correlate with ICP.

Borders can be determined automatically to save time, but they not always are defined perfectly. The paper describes the algorithm for the correction of the borders of English voiced allophones obtained automatically. It shows a method for modifying them in order to obtain the boundaries determined more precisely. It was achieved by comparing the initial periods of the laryngeal tone in the voiced allophones for the beginning of the allophone, and the periods at the end of the allophone for the case of a modification introduced to the end border of allophone. It relies on the features obtained employing the algorithm for automatic marking of allophone boundaries based on which the correction is performed.

It allows continuous control of the output voltage by acting on the IGBTs activation time: “on-time.” The final after-charging capacitors' voltage can be higher than the double of the input voltage. A simplified mathematical description of the system was developed in order to find a relation between the output voltage and the “On-time” (an open-loop control law). A SPICE simulation was implemented to check the expected performances and to verify the developed model. A three-stage generator was built according to the proposed structure using commercial IGBTs with a maximum output voltage of 3.6 kV.

Here, we aim to compare three methods for CrCP estimation in scenario of a controlled increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), induced by infusion tests performed in patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Methods: Computer recordings of directly-measured ICP, ABP, and transcranial Doppler cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), from 37 NPH patients undergoing infusion tests, were retrospectively analyzed. The CrCP was calculated with three methods: one with the first harmonics ratio of the pulse waveforms of ABP and CBFV (CrCPA) and two methods based on a model of cerebrovascular impedance, as functions of both cerebral perfusion pressure (CrCPinv), and of ABP (CrCPninv). Conclusion: All methods give similar results in response to ICP changes. In the case of individual CrCP measurements for each patient, CrCPA may provide negative, nonphysiological values. Invasive critical closing pressure is most sensitive to variations in ICP and CPP and can be used as an indicator of the cerebrospinal and the cerebrovascular system status during infusion tests.",1558-2531,,10.1109/TBME.2017.2707547,Mossakowski Medical Research Centre Polish Academy of Sciences and Institute of Electronic Systems; Warsaw University of Technology; European Union in the framework of the European Social Fund; Warsaw University of Technology Development Programme; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7933212,Biomedical signal processing;critical closing pressure;intracranial pressure;infusion test;wall tension,Iterative closest point algorithm;Mercury (metals);Blood flow;Harmonic analysis;Impedance;Estimation;Heart rate,biomedical ultrasonics;blood flow measurement;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;brain;diseases;Doppler measurement;medical signal processing,normal pressure hydrocephalus;critical closing pressure;CrCP measurements;ABP pulse waveforms;CrCP estimation;cerebral blood flow ceases;arterial vessels collapse;arterial blood pressure threshold;cerebral perfusion pressure;transcranial Doppler cerebral blood flow velocity;infusion tests;intracranial pressure,,,16,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

In the railway area, there are intentional and unintentional electromagnetic (stationary and mobile) interference which affect the operation process of the LED type lighting modules. In the article, the electromagnetic compatibility tests of the lighting module with a converter were carried out with the use of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) receiver of the ESCI3 type and the NNB-51 artificial network. As a result of the carried-out electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests, the exceeding of permissible levels of the value of conducted interference emissions was found. The electromagnetic interference of this frequency range has an impact on the operation process of the lighting module with a converter, therefore, by using the appropriate relationships, the values of the probabilities of the system staying in the distinguished operation states were calculated (e.g., in two states of partial suitability distinguished in the LED lighting module due to parallel coupling through reference impedance Z and capacity C).

The localization of machines, sensors and workers inside the industrial premises is one of such interfaces used by many applications. Current localization-based systems are unable to deal with highly variable conditions, meaning that the solutions working well in stationary systems suffer from considerable difficulties in harsh environments, such as factories. As a result, the precision of localization techniques is not satisfactory in most industrial applications. This paper fills in the existing gap between static approaches and dynamic indoor positioning systems, by presenting a solution adapting the system to highly changeable conditions.

Initially, the algorithm extracts the propagation constant of printed coplanar waveguide (CPW) standards by the use of a multiline thru-reflect-line calibration. Then, the proposed algorithm utilizes finite-element modeling to dynamically create an interpolated search space by automatic simulation.

Subjectively it means based on the comparison of simulation images made with different accuracy, with post-implementation photographs of these projects, objectively - on the basis of measurements of the luminance of the completed project and their reference to distributions previously generated by computer. The field measurements carried out as well as surveys have clearly shown that computer simulations in the form of raster images are a reliable design tool in the hands of a lighting designer. The future of the lighting design is also presented.",,978-1-5386-7924-1,10.1109/LUMENV.2018.8521038,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521038,floodlighting;lighting design;advanced lighting simulation;virtual reality of lighting,Lighting;Visualization;Computer simulation;Computational modeling;Photography;Tools;Image color analysis,brightness;data visualisation;lighting;rendering (computer graphics),lighting design;photorealistic computer simulations;interior lighting;representative lighting;reliable design tool;lighting designer,,,29,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Multimode Stepped-Impedance Resonator (SIR) with Central Via-Coupling for UWB Filter Design,M. Zukocinski,"Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, 00-665, Poland",2019 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS),,2019,,,1,4,"This paper discusses a new type of planar stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) - a structure centrally loaded with a via to the ground. The novel SIR has unique properties which can be used to design wideband and ultra-wideband (UWB) filters. The shunt via provides a strong inductive coupling in the centre of the structure, which determines a new mechanism of coupling the SIR modes. The central via modifies electromagnetic field distribution of the SIR filter creating in its frequency response an additional transmission pole in the passband. It also provides a transmission zero at DC, which allows for a direct contact port coupling, with no need for the more problematic, very narrow gaps to couple the structure with input/output lines. Thanks to this, the new SIR can be successfully designed and fabricated on thin dielectric substrates. The gapless couplings require impedance matching between input/output lines and the SIR. This is realized by stepped-impedance transformer sections. Depending on the filter bandwidth, these port matching sections can be non-resonating, or begin to resonate generating additional transmission poles. These properties are discussed in the paper based on two example microstrip bandpass filters: a 4-pole 3.1 - 4.8 GHz and a 6-pole 3.1 - 10.6 GHz UWB filter.",2164-2974,978-1-5386-5944-1,10.1109/RWS.2019.8714429,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714429,microwave filter;ultra-wideband filter;stepped-impedance resonator;via coupling;gapless structure,Band-pass filters;Microwave filters;Resonator filters;Matched filters;Couplings;Filtering theory;Passband,band-pass filters;frequency response;impedance matching;microstrip filters;microwave filters;microwave resonators;resonator filters,SIR modes;electromagnetic field distribution;SIR filter;additional transmission pole;direct contact port coupling;gapless couplings;impedance matching;stepped-impedance transformer sections;multimode stepped-impedance resonator;central via-coupling;UWB filter design;ultra-wideband filters;inductive coupling;input-output lines;microstrip bandpass filters;frequency response;transmission zero;thin dielectric substrates;frequency 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz,,,4,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Avoiding Currents Overshoot in IPOP DAB System,M. Rolak,"Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT),,2019,,,1737,1742,"Constant progress in power electronics and growing participation of renewable sources in a total energy market results in much interest of Energy Storages (ES) as well. Their popularity implies increasing power ranges what often may be assured by parallel connection of DC/DC ES converters for example in an Input Parallel Output Parallel (IPOP) manner. On the other hand, varying voltage of the ES results in various power range of the system, thus in given conditions all parallel operating converters are not necessarily required and may even worsen the overall efficiency. Then, a dynamic connection or disconnection (engaging and dismissing) of parallel devices is required regarding to actual power demands and ES's voltage level. When the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter is used as the DC/DC topology it may be easily performed by setting zero signals for all transistors of the whole converter. Unfortunately, repetitive engaging and dismissing the whole converter module stresses its components such high frequency transformer's and power mosfets. This may result in harmful EMF introduction and affects overall reliability. This paper presents a simple method to improve process within a two-module IPOP DAB system in a manner where currents overshoots are reduced. It is achieved by adequate modulation modification and proper perfilter application.

An alternative method for verification of common mode absorption devices,J. Sroka,"Laboratory of High Voltage and Electromagnetic Compatibility, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland",IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Magazine,,2017,6,3,61,66,"Common Mode Absorption Devices CMADs are absorbing clamps required in the set ups for measurement of radiated disturbances. They should be verified with Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs), which unfortunately have coaxial ports. A CMAD can be connected to the VNA only if it is embedded in adapters. In the verification process, the clamp must be deembedded, i.e. the contribution of adapters must be extracted from the measured S-parameters. The Thru-Reflect-Line TRL calibration of the VNA is a suitable tool for that task, provided the necessary hardware and software facilities of the VNAs are available. If not, alternatives are required. In this paper, the alternative calibration is presented. The symmetry of adapters allows omitting the Reflect-step, providing this approach is preceded with the Short-Open-Thru-Match SOTM calibration. The method presented here consists of two steps only: the Thrustep in which adapters are cascaded face to face and the Linestep in which the rod line is inserted between the adapters. These two standards can have unknown S-parameters. Validation of the method consists in verification of the CMAD available on the market.

Advanced Luminance Modeling of Light Sources for Simulation and Computational Purposes of Lighting Parameters,S. Słomiński,"Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Lighting Technology Division, Warsaw University of Technology, Electrical Power Engineering Institute, Warsaw, Poland",2018 VII. Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4),,2018,,,1,5,"The last decade is the time of a very dynamic development of lighting technology. This development covers many areas that complement each other. The development of light sources, luminaires, measurement techniques and design methods make it necessary to develop new, effective tools to support the design and analysis of lighting equipment. In lighting technology, the most common analysis is made of such parameters as the illuminance, luminance distribution and discomfort glare, inseparable from the specificity of modern light sources. A characteristic feature of almost all of them is high luminance, on the level of 107- 108cd/m2. High luminance facilitates the design of very precise optical systems, but also it is strongly associated with the possibility of discomfort associated with glare. Current methods of glare analysis in simulation software are related to conversion to the average luminance value of the luminaire, saved as simplified light parameters in electronic files (IES, LDT or similar). Currently the calculations take place as a result of calculation ratio the value of luminous intensity in a given direction and the surface area of the dimension of the luminaires in the same direction. This can lead to a significant understatement of the luminance of the luminaire in any situation where luminous intensity comes from the heterogeneous luminance distribution on the surface of the luminaire. This situation most often occurs in luminaires with high-luminance light sources with a reflector system and in the case of multi-source luminaires with lenses - eg multi-LED luminaires. The paper presents advanced methods of luminance modelling of light sources developed as a result of digital measurements of luminance distributions. A comparative analysis of the accuracy of the simulation calculations of the analytical lighting fixture model will be presented.

These three years have been chosen based on the time when spatial planning law was introduced and different local zoning plans for Warsaw were passed, including preserved areas for the ventilation corridors. The roughness parameters mapping focuses mainly on frontal area index calculation and itis based on the building database partially derived from satellite imagery (SPOT). Comparison of the derived corridors with the officially planned preservation areas suggests inaccuracies in their extent, identifies obstacles that occurred over almost twenty years and calls for an evaluation.

A 5.8–10.6 GHz UWB filter using novel SIR structure,M. Żukociński,"Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2018 22nd International Microwave and Radar Conference (MIKON),,2018,,,477,480,The paper presents a set of 3 ultra-wideband bandpass filters for the upper UWB band (5.8 GHz to 10.6 GHz). The filters are development versions of a novel multi-mode stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) planar structure with central via to ground. The new SIR is implemented in microstrip technology. It has a single centrally located via to ground which provides a new mechanism for coupling of the SIR modes. The first filter presented in the paper follows the basic concept of the new SIR whereas the other two filters exploit longitudinal symmetry to bisect the SIR and create half-structures. The second filter uses an in-line cascade of two half-structures while the third filter is a folded cascade of the two half-structures. These examples show basic properties with pros and cons of the new SIR. The cascade of the two half-structures is used to easily increase resultant filter order and performance of frequency characteristics. Folding the cascade can be used to build a new filter structure with some potentially interesting properties. One of the benefits of the presented SIR filters is a direct contact port coupling and no need for more problematic very narrow gaps to couple the structure with the input and output lines. This in turn allows for making the new filters on thin substrates. Another benefit is an extended stop band comparing to the classic SIR.,,978-83-949421-1-3,10.23919/MIKON.2018.8405261,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405261,bandpass filter;ultra-wideband (UWB);stepped-impedance resonator (SIR);multi-mode resonator (MMR),Band-pass filters;Microwave filters;Resonator filters;Couplings;Matched filters;Substrates;Filtering theory,band-pass filters;microstrip filters;resonator filters;ultra wideband technology,ultra-wideband bandpass filters;microstrip technology;SIR planar structure;SIR filters;multimode stepped-impedance resonator;UWB filter;frequency 5.8 GHz to 10.6 GHz,,1,10,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

In such conditions, in liquids, high-pressure phase transitions (solidification) can occur that substantially increase the density and liquid viscosity. This solidification can result in significant problems with engine failure under cold-start conditions. This is an evident recipe for disaster, since the engine and its accessories would be very likely quickly destroyed. Thus, it is important to determine at what pressures and temperatures phase transitions occur. Conventional mechanical methods for measuring physicochemical properties of liquids at these extreme conditions do not operate. By contrast, ultrasonic techniques are very suitable for measurements of physicochemical properties of liquids at high pressure, since they are non-destructive, can be fully automated and are characterized by the absence of moving parts. The aim of this work is to study the high-pressure physicochemical properties of liquids (exemplified by a Camelina sativa - false flax oil) using novel ultrasonic methods.",1948-5727,978-1-5386-3383-0,10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092656,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8092656,high pressure;ultrasonic methods;phase transitions;Camelina sativa,Oils;Liquids;Temperature measurement;Acoustics;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Pressure measurement;Fuels,biofuel;diesel engines;fuel systems;high-pressure effects;oils;ultrasonic measurement;viscosity,ultrasonic methods;biofuel;engine failure;high-pressure physicochemical properties;temperatures phase transitions;cold-start conditions;liquid viscosity;density;solidification;high-pressure phase transitions;diesel engines;modern fuel injection systems;high pressure food preservation;industrial technological processes;liquid media;anomalous behavior;regular behavior,,,18,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Validated prediction of the thermal-hydraulics during the depressurization is important by virtue of wide implementation of pressurized vessels in chemical and power engineering. Particular emphasis was put on the implementation of the vessel in the field of steam storage and as the reactor pressure vessel of the boiling water reactor design. In both cases, the vessel is filled up to a certain level with saturated liquid water. The rest of the vessel is occupied by saturated steam. In case of the pressure decrease e.g. due to discharging of the steam from the vessel or due to the loss of coolant accident in a nuclear power plant, the liquid water evaporates abruptly, being a reason, thereby, of strong transients in the vessel. These transients and the sudden emergence of void in the region occupied at the beginning by liquid, cause elevation of the two-phase mixture. Prediction of this elevation - called the water level swell - is important from the view point of safe operation of the device. In this work, a model calculating liquid water collapse level and two-phase level swell is presented and validated against experimental data.

Flashover Analysis of Near-Space Antenna Mounting Insulators,T. Aleksander,"Division of Radiocommunication Institute of Radioelectronics and Multimedia Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland",2019 13th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP),,2019,,,1,5,"This paper discusses the problem of the flashovers of the insulators supporting long antennas in balloon flight applications. The antennas are to be operated in the stratosphere, where the low air pressure increases the risk of flashover. To analyze the problem, the Paschen's law was applied to three thermodynamic data sets recorded during two different stratospheric balloon missions, launched in December and April 2015 (the April flight also with an experiment of additional heat-up due to solar radiation absorption). To estimate the influence of the humidity present in the cloud layers, a humid flashover case, previously investigated by the RCA on ground, was recalculated for stratospheric environment. The analyses show that the flashover voltage decreases rapidly with pressure-determined altitude and is higher for colder months of the year, which makes the system safer when operated at that time. Higher humidity reduces significantly the maximum flashover voltage, even the air gap remained three times larger than for the dry flashovers. Basic design requirements were formed for the stratospheric antenna mounting insulator in order to maintain the flight safety during high voltage operations.",,978-88-907018-8-7,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8739554,flashover;high voltage;balloon;antenna systems;Paschen’s law;stratosphere;VLF,Flashover;Insulators;Terrestrial atmosphere;Dipole antennas;Temperature measurement;High-voltage techniques,air gaps;balloons;flashover;humidity;solar radiation;stratosphere,high voltage operations;near-space antenna mounting insulators;long antennas;balloon flight applications;low air pressure;Paschen's law;thermodynamic data sets;April flight;solar radiation absorption;cloud layers;humid flashover case;stratospheric environment;pressure-determined altitude;maximum flashover voltage;air gap;dry flashovers;stratospheric antenna mounting insulator;flight safety;stratospheric balloon missions;heat-up;humidity,,,6,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical Causes of Errors During Measuring Luminance Distributions in Relation to Glare Calculations,S. Słomiński,"Electrical Power Engineering Institute Lighting Technology Division, Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Warsaw, Poland",2018 VII. Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4),,2018,,,1,5,"The number of high luminance light sources commonly used in lighting technology is systematically growing, causing an increase in number of potential problems. One of them is the problem of discomfort glare and ways to measure it. Both calculation and measurement methods connected with this parameter have a series of disadvantages and advantages. Among the serious disadvantages, there can be dominant digital “models” of light sources and luminaires, which do not include, practically, any direct information on luminance distribution. To make the measurement results correspond to the calculation results, computer simulations and visual impression of the people assessing the lighting, the measuring devices should correctly record the analyzed parameters. The accurate parameters recording means the situation under which the measurement result is possibly close to what the human eye records. The modern measurement systems, among which there are undoubtedly ILMDs - Imaging luminance measuring devices, are potentially ideal to record all parameters used to calculate glare. Research done by the author proves that especially as far as the small light sources are concerned, such as LEDs and multi-source luminaire systems the parameters of the equipment used have a big influence on the measurement results. Especially, an angular field of view of single pixel of the digital sensor, which relates to a CCD or CMOS sensor size, dimensions of single photo-cell, focal length and technology that is used to make this device (B/W, color). A problem of the influence of depth of field of digital recording equipment with respect to the measured luminance values was dealt with.

Similarly, in modern fuel injection systems for diesel engines, biofuel is subjected to a pressure up to 300 MPa. In such conditions, in liquids, phase transitions can occur that substantially increase the density and liquid viscosity. This can be very detrimental for the engine or the technological equipment. Thus, it is important to determine at what pressures and temperatures phase transitions occur. Conventional mechanical methods for measuring physicochemical properties of liquids at these extreme conditions do not operate. By contrast, ultrasonic techniques are very suitable for measurements of physicochemical properties of liquids at high pressure, since they are non-destructive and can be fully automated.

The results showed that the real part of dielectric permittivity of the tested products decreased with an increase of frequency, while the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity increased below 14.3 GHz for yoghurt and 13.6 GHz for milks and decreased above those frequencies.

Many authors tried to estimate the potential benefits of such a solution. The main principle of the DBL system is to activate an exclusive bus lane (XBL) when a bus approaches a designated road segment and to deactivate XBL when the bus leaves the segment, making the lane available to all road users. The new solution requires additional infrastructure like variable message signs and in-pavement lights, informing drivers whether the DBL is active or not. One of the popular tools to evaluate the new solution is a traffic microsimulation model. Unfortunately, the available software has no ready tools for simulating the activation and deactivation process of the DBL. The paper proposes a new method for modelling DBL control in the PTV Vissim environment. Traffic simulation model was set up to analyze the DBL operation on a street in Rzeszow with an existing exclusive bus lane.

Presently, these accelerator facilities are operated with pulsed RF. In the future, these facilities will operate with the continuous wave (CW), which requires significant modifications on the real-time feedbacks realized within the FPGA. For example, higher loaded quality factor of the superconducting RF cavities operated in the CW mode requires sophisticated resonance control methods. However, iterative learning techniques widely used for machines operated in pulsed mode are not applicable for the CW. In addition, the mechanical characteristic of the cavities now have a much more important impact on the choice of the feedback scheme. To overcome the limitations of classical proportional-integral controllers, a novel real-time adaptive feed-forward algorithm is implemented in the FPGA. Also, the high power RF amplifier, which is an inductive output tube (IOT) for CW operation instead of a klystron for the pulsed mode, has a major impact on the design and implementation of the firmware for regulation.

The goal of these modules is to incorporate additional signal, i.e. information about known labels, into the inference procedure, and adjust the predicted output accordingly. Since the attached plugins have a simple structure, consisting of only fully connected layers, we drastically reduced the computational cost of training and inference. Also, the proposed architecture allows propagating information about known labels directly to the intermediate layers to improve the final representation.

As the DAQ works under harsh radiation environment, there is a fair chance of data corruption due to various energetic particles like alpha, beta, or neutron. Hence, a major challenge in the development of DAQ in the HEP experiment is to establish an error resilient communication system between front-end sensors or detectors and back-end data processing computing nodes. Here, we have implemented the DAQ using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) due to some of its inherent advantages over the application-specific integrated circuit. A novel orthogonal concatenated code and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) have been used to mitigate the effects of data corruption in the user data. Scrubbing with a 32-b CRC has been used against error in the configuration memory of FPGA. Data from front-end sensors will reach to the back-end processing nodes through multiple stages that may add an uncertain amount of delay to the different data packets. We have also proposed a novel memory management algorithm that helps to process the data at the back-end computing nodes removing the added path delays. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FPGA-based DAQ utilizing optical link with channel coding and efficient memory management modules can be considered as first of its kind.

Alterations in chromosome structure can disrupt interactions between gene promoters and their regulatory elements or place genes in an inappropriate chromosomal domain. Evaluation of the impact of such genomic aberrations on gene expression has been often neglected, especially when other structural variants (SVs) affecting genes are detected. Another reason for not considering such rearrangements has been the lack of appropriate methods or tools to visualize and prioritize the neighboring genes according to their clinical relevance.To address these challenges, we developed TADeus, an easy-to-use open-source web application dedicated for clinical evaluation of variants in genes whose expression may be affected by chromosomal rearrangements. The main functionality of TADeus provides a view of regulatory landscape of regions surrounding breakpoints of the rearrangements by combing chromatin conformation data (Hi-C) with other omics data. TADeus prioritizes genes using number of interrupted enhancer-promoter interactions, the distance from the breakpoints, the phenotypic data, and haploinsufficiency scores.

It has four subtypes: Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2-enriched (HER2-E) and Basal-like (BL). For the cause of breast cancer subtypes, there are different genetic and epigenetic factors involved in its progression and susceptibility. Thus, the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic biomarkers can be helpful to understand the biological mechanisms better and to improve the diagnostic processes of this disease and its subtypes. Hence, this fact motivated us to investigate the epigenetic factor, such as DNA Methylation, with the integration of gene expression in order to find epigenetic biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes. In this regard, we have identified set of up and down regulated genes for each subtype using differential analysis. Thereafter, regression based feature ranking problem is formed in order to find the DNA Methylation site that is mostly responsible for the change in expression of a gene, which is considered as an epigenetic biomarker. A bagging integrated ensemble of decision trees is used for the same. The results of top ten up and down regulated genes and their corresponding most significant DNA Methylation sites are reported for breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, these genes are validated visually by means of survival and expression plots, showing TF-Gene-DNA Methylation interactions, Protein-Protein interaction network, KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. The results show that top differentially expressed up and down regulated genes viz. MMP11, NUF2, EXO1, HJURP, HOXA4, SYNM, CAV1 and COL4A3BP in breast cancer subtypes may change their expression because of DNA Methylation sites viz. cg22418565, cg26029744, cg24741598, cg04550103, cg25952581, cg02109162, cg18498156 and cg04985097 respectively.

Post-mortem iris recognition, despite being a potentially useful method that could aid forensic identification, can also pose challenges when used inappropriately, i.e. utilizing a dead organ of a person in an unauthorized way. Our approach is based on the VGG-16 architecture fine-tuned with a database of 574 post-mortem, near-infrared iris images from the WarsawBioBase-PostMortem-Iris-v1 database, complemented by a dataset of 256 images of live irises, collected within the scope of this study. Experiments described in this paper show that our approach is able to correctly classify iris images as either representing a live or a dead eye in almost 99% of the trials, averaged over 20 subject-disjoint, train/test splits. We also show that the post-mortem iris detection accuracy increases as time since death elapses, and that we are able to construct a classification system with APCER=0%@BPCER≈1% (Attack Presentation and Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rates, respectively) when only post-mortem samples collected at least 16 hours post-mortem are considered. Since acquisitions of ante- and post-mortem samples differ significantly, we applied countermeasures to minimize bias in our classification methodology caused by image properties that are not related to the PAD. This included using the same iris sensor in collection of ante- and post-mortem samples, and analysis of class activation maps to ensure that discriminant iris regions utilized by our classifier are related to properties of the eye, and not to those of the acquisition protocol. This paper offers the first known to us PAD method in a postmortem setting, together with an explanation of the decisions made by the convolutional neural network.

In this work, AFCS with receiver diversity, specifically EGC is studied and investigated. AFCS system model is developed, its performance is investigated and studied based on MSE calculation. The analysis showed that the AFCS system with diversity has improved the MSE and power bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, with EGC desired MSE can be achieved in less number of iterations.

Classic data analysis algorithms are no longer valid for assuring security at all levels and a new approach to data sciences is required, which would consider the complex heterogeneous nature of the IoT, taking also into consideration, its potential to deploy cross layer for security assessment mechanisms. Furthermore, data collected from sensors should be processed and analyzed nearly in real time. The classical algorithms have two main drawbacks: 1) they deal with unidimensional data and 2) they fail to assume limited information available in the stream data processing. In this article, new solutions are discussed and presented that detect anomalies in data streams nearly in real time. Specifically, we propose: 1) an event detection method used in unidimensional data streams and relying on the event strength function, which is an extension of the typical “True or False” decision-making scheme; 2) multiple-criteria event detection approaches based on the Dynamic Pareto Set, introducing a time-depending decision set; and 3) an anomaly detection method based on multicriteria temporal graphs, combining the dynamics of decision making and multicriteria.

The data for each subject was acquired in three different sessions, with two first sessions organized on the same day, and the third session organized approximately two weeks apart. This allowed to analyze the stability of hand temperature in both short-term and long-term horizons. No hand stabilization or positioning devices were used during acquisition, making this setup closer to real-world, unconstrained applications. This required making our method translation-, rotation- and scale-invariant. Two approaches for feature selection and classification are proposed and compared: feature engineering deploying texture descriptors such as Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and Gabor wavelets, and feature learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained in different environmental conditions.

Each of the underground RF stations consists of a multibeam horizontal klystron that can provide up to 10 MW of power at 1.3 GHz. Klystrons are sensitive devices with a limited lifetime and a high mean time between failures. In real operation, the lifetime of the tube can be significantly reduced because of failures. The special fast protection klystron lifetime management (KLM) system has been developed to minimize the influence of service conditions on the lifetime of klystrons. The main task of this system is to detect all events which can destroy the tube as quickly as possible, and switch off the driving RF signal or the high voltage. Detection of events is based on a comparison of the value of the real signal obtained at the system output with the value estimated on the basis of a high-power RF amplifier model and input signals. The KLM system has been realized in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and implemented in XFEL. Implementation is based on the standard low-level RF micro telecommunications computing architecture (MTCA.4 or xTCA).

"Theoretical preconditions for development of perfect communication channels ""small satellites – earth""",A. Platonov,"Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",2019 IEEE 5th International Workshop on Metrology for AeroSpace (MetroAeroSpace),,2019,,,142,147,"The paper discusses the possibilities to improve reliability and quality of data transmission over forward channel ""small satellite (ST) - ground base station (BS)"" using adaptive feedback communication systems (AFCS). The main advantage of AFCS as compare to the known CS is their capability to transmit both analog and digital signals ""perfectly"" that is with a bit rate [bit/s] equal to the capacity of the forward channel ST-BS, maximal accuracy, and fixed bit error rate (reliability). The perfect AFCS are narrowband systems transmitting signals in real time with the energy [bit/J] and spectral [bit/s/Hz] efficiencies attaining the limit values established by information theory. The source of these advantages is replacement of coding units by the analog modulators adaptively adjusted by controls delivered to ST from BS over high-quality feedback channels. The latter one simplifies a construction of the ST transmitters, as well reduces their energy consumption, cost and sizes. Moreover, adaptive properties of AFCS permit to maintain the perfect mode of transmission during overall time of the contact between the satellite and BS. The aim of the paper is presentations of theoretical basis enabling a development and application of improved (perfect) AFCS for ST-BS communications. The presented results are confirmed in experiments with hardware prototype of the perfect AFCS.

Methodology to Reduce the Number of Switches in Frequency Reconfigurable Antennas With Massive Switches,C. Wu; Z. Yang; Y. Li; Y. Zhang; Y.

The proposed method is performed by removing the less important switches of an RA. Therefore, the RA only has a few important switches that have strong influences on the reconfigurability. The importance of a switch is evaluated by the minimum percentage of useful configurations (PUC). A monopole-type omni-directional frequency RA with 85 uniformly-distributed switches is optimized in this paper. For this type of antennas, a reflection coefficient less than -20 dB and a gain greater than 0 dBi at the same frequency makes a useful configuration. After reducing the switch number from 85 to 15, the complexity of the RA is greatly decreased while the reconfigurability is increased by more than 100 times within the band of 2 to 7 GHz. With only 15 optimally deployed switches, the PUC is significantly increased. Therefore, it is easy to find out the states of the switches to let the frequency RA work well at different frequencies.

Generative Multi-Symbol Architecture of the Binary Arithmetic Coder for UHDTV Video Encoders,G. Pastuszak,"Institute of Radioelectronics and Multimedia Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,,2020,67,3,891,902,"Binary arithmetic coding is a key part of recent video compression standards. Its throughput is limited by the inherent dependencies existing in the algorithm. As a consequence, a higher bin parallelism leads to lower clock frequencies. This paper presents an architecture able to exceed limits existing in previous hardware implementations. The architecture exploits less probable symbols as starting points for long series of bins coded in one clock cycle. The evaluation for four possible cases of the range value allows its update in the pipeline before the delayed selection based on actual value. The adaptive division into series is proposed to make long series more frequent. To shorten critical paths, rMPS variables computed for symbols coded in the same clock cycle are first summed and then added to the low register. Up to 16 bypass-mode symbols can be processed in parallel with context-coded symbols in one clock cycle. The architecture is generative, i.e., its throughput can be scaled with resources without strict limits. For example, the binary arithmetic coder synthesized on 90nm TSMC technology which consumes 101.4k gates and operates at the 570 MHz has the average throughput of 13.4 bins per clock cycle for the high-quality H.265/HEVC compression.",1558-0806,,10.1109/TCSI.2019.2949882,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897118,CABAC;binary arithmetic coding;entropy coding;video encoder;VLSI;FPGA;UHDTV;H264/AVC;H265/HEVC,Registers;Throughput;Encoding;Clocks;Computer architecture;Standards;Streaming media,arithmetic codes;binary codes;data compression;high definition television;video coding,video compression standards;clock frequencies;hardware implementations;clock cycle;range value;context-coded symbols;binary arithmetic coder;multisymbol architecture;UHDTV video encoders;binary arithmetic coding;bypass-mode symbols;bin parallelism;size 90.0 nm;frequency 570.0 MHz,,,15,IEEE,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Table-Based Model of a Dual-Gate Transistor for Statistical Circuit Simulation,D. Kasprowicz,"Institute of Microelectronics and Optoelectronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,,2019,38,8,1493,1500,"Table-based models of semiconductor devices are an attractive solution if a physics-based analytical model of the device cannot be found or has insufficient accuracy. Moreover, table-based models offer easy tradeoff between evaluation speed and accuracy. Traditionally, the biggest disadvantage of this class of model has been the inability to take device variability into account. This paper presents a table-based model that can handle process-induced variations of multiple device parameters. The impact of those variations on device operation is modeled analytically using special transformations of the current-voltage and charge-voltage characteristics of the nominal (i.e., variation-free) device. In contrast to multidimensional interpolation between the I-V and Q-V curves of “corner” devices, the proposed approach is much less costly in terms of CPU time, RAM use, and time dedicated to device characterization. The model has been successfully used in statistical simulations of an amplifier and ring oscillator built with VeSFETs-dual-gate junctionless transistors.",1937-4151,,10.1109/TCAD.2018.2852756,Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403271,Dual-gate transistor;look-up table (LUT);process-induced variability;table-based model;VeSFET,Integrated circuit modeling;Table lookup;Semiconductor device modeling;Transistors;Interpolation;Analytical models;Logic gates,circuit simulation;interpolation;junctionless nanowire transistors;oscillators;semiconductor device models;statistical analysis,table-based model;physics-based analytical model;multiple device parameters;process-induced variations;dual-gate transistor;statistical circuit simulation;VeSFET-dual-gate junctionless transistors;charge-voltage characteristics;multidimensional interpolation;ring oscillator,,,20,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, we study reliability through replication in a number of MEC-servers, timeliness through Age of Information (AoI) and load reduction by leveraging the X2 interface at the edge, in order to abort useless frame rendering computations. We translate it as a scenario where a sink - representing the UE - is interested in the freshest possible update from distributed nodes. Each node sends updates following a Last Come First Served (LCFS) policy with preemption. We consider two scenarios; the first is n parallel LCFS systems sending updates, and the second adds a feedback loop aimed at decreasing the number of jobs sent per second by the nodes, thus decreasing the load per node. We analyze the number of jobs sent per second and average peak Age of Information at the sink, showing that the second scheme achieves a significantly lower rate of jobs compared with the first, while maintaining constant AoI, thus reducing the load at the edge.

This leads to a greater concentration of pollution and increased temperature in urban areas. A proper urban design may promote the air flow and mitigate these negative phenomena.

The concept is based on the morphometric analyses, where roughness parameters (such as roughness length and displacement height), as well as porosity are investigated as opposed to previous studies. Commonly available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data enable more detailed terrain study, as the topography and obstacle features (type, dimensions, and porosity) might be investigated. In comparison to the previous studies and long adapted practices, this approach takes advantage of all information incorporated in LiDAR data to deliver even more accurate results. The comparison of the detected corridors, with the officially designed corridors in our study area in Warsaw, suggests inaccuracies in their extent (only 40% of their areas might still be functioning) and calls for an evaluation.

Lis,"Institute of Econometrics, Warsaw School of Economics, Poland; Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland",2017 6th International Youth Conference on Energy (IYCE),,2017,,,1,6,"Deregulation of wholesale energy markets has brought many challenges and one of them is the accuracy of price forecasting methods. In the environment where price is set not only by matching supply (generation side) and demand (utilities and customer side) but is also influenced by various factors such as capacity, ancillary services and transmission congestion, the most popular forecasting tools are performing poorly. Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly important to all market participants in the competitive electric power markets. The goal of this paper is to present a price - forecasting method which uses optimized set of parameters to predict the price for the next hour. The model consists of an objective function describing the minimum difference between real price for current hour and forecasted price for the same hour. It is constrained by four equations describing current demand, supply, price and also its forecasted values. The whole system comprised of dynamic discrete model of which fundamentals are described by the author in the previous paper. The forecast accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with real data from the Californian ISO day-ahead energy market. The proposed method provides significant innovation in area of price - forecasting tools and is characterized as new approach compared to most popular techniques applied to energy markets.",,978-1-5090-6409-0,10.1109/IYCE.2017.8003746,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003746,day-ahead electricity market;optimization;price forecasting;dynamic discrete model,Mathematical model;Forecasting;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Pricing;Optimization;Electricity supply industry,ISO standards;optimisation;power markets;pricing,electricity price forecasting;optimization problem;discrete dynamic model;energy markets deregulation;matching supply;transmission congestion;pricing strategies;electric power markets;Californian ISO day-ahead energy market;price-forecasting tools;energy markets,,2,13,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,
Siphon-Based Deadlock Detection in Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS),W. B. Daszczuk,"Warsaw University of Technology, Institute of Computer Science, Nowowiejska Str. 15/19,00-665, Warsaw, Poland",2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS),,2018,,,1,11,"Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS) is a formalism for specification and verification of distributed systems, especially following IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm. The formalism emphasizes such features as asynchrony of actions and communication, locality of decisions, and autonomy in executing actions. In conjunction with model checking, IMDS allows to analyze such features of distributed systems as deadlocks or distributed termination. However, the nature of model checking allows to find one deadlock in a single run of the verifier, which produces a counterexample. The conversion of IMDS specification to a Petri net is used to identify multiple deadlocks in one verification, using siphons. Model checking is used to verify if a siphon can become empty, which denotes a true deadlock in a purely cyclic system, like FMS (Flexible Manufacturing Systems). The extension of the verification by temporal checking allows to cover systems with any structure: cyclic, terminating, or with a more complex scheme. In addition, the proposed procedure allows to easily identify processes participating in partial deadlocks. Two types of deadlock can be identified: communication deadlocks and resource deadlocks.",,978-83-949419-5-6,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511235,,System recovery;Servers;Model checking;Petri nets;Internet of Things;Frequency modulation;Computer science,concurrency control;flexible manufacturing systems;Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);Petri nets;system recovery,communication deadlocks;siphon-based deadlock detection;model checking;distributed termination;IMDS specification;flexible manufacturing systems;integrated model of distributed systems;IoT;Internet of Things;Petri net,,,40,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, splitting content into multiple independent sub-streams provides the opportunity to achieve easy-to-design bitrate adaptation and server-switching mechanisms.

Harmonic power sharing between power electronics converters in islanded AC microgrid,A. Milczarek,"Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, ul. Koszykowa 75, 00-662, Poland",2017 Progress in Applied Electrical Engineering (PAEE),,2017,,,1,7,"The dynamic evolution of renewable energy sources (RESs) with utilization of power electronics converters (PECs) caused the situation, where many energy generation units works parallel in local systems named microgrids (MGs). This distributed generation systems with many few kW micro-sources have to provide energy for linear and non-linear loads in grid connected mode of operation, but also in islanded mode of operation, which requires more advanced monitoring and energy management algorithms to ensure power balance and good voltage quality. The issues of power management in islanded AC microgrids are studied by many research centres and novel solutions are necessary to improve the reliability of MGs. In literature, there is still a gap for development of harmonic power sharing method in MG with most often used non-linear loads. Together with active and reactive power management algorithms the harmonic power sharing algorithm need to be implemented in control system to obtain complete solutions. The most often used approach in MG is hierarchical control structure, which includes the basic control loops at primary level, independent for each of PECs and outer control loops at secondary level, which allow to improve voltage amplitude and frequency in point of common coupling, as well as power sharing between PECs. Moreover, the hierarchical control structure is a great opportunity to implement a distributed control algorithm, which is able to execute many operations in the same time. Based on this idea, the novel proportional harmonic power sharing algorithm has been developed. It causes the harmonic power sharing between PECs proportionally to active powers, improving the output current waveforms of converters by decreasing the amplitude of selected current harmonics. The principles of hierarchical droop control and reactive power management has been presented in this paper. The developed solution has been implemented in simulation research together with proportional reactive power sharing algorithm. In order to present the advantage of harmonic power sharing, the results have been compared with non-controlled harmonic power.",,978-1-5386-1528-7,10.1109/PAEE.2017.8008991,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008991,microgrid;islanded mode of operation;harmonic power sharing;droop control,Harmonic analysis;Reactive power;Power harmonic filters;Voltage control;Microgrids,distributed control;distributed power generation;energy management systems;power conversion harmonics;power electronics;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation reliability;power grids;reactive power control;renewable energy sources,harmonic power sharing;power electronic converter;islanded AC microgrid;dynamic RES evolution;dynamic renewable energy source evolution;energy generation unit;distributed generation system;islanded mode;grid connected mode;energy management algorithm;voltage quality;power balance;MG reliability improvement;active power management algorithm;reactive power management algorithm;harmonic power sharing algorithm;hierarchical control structure;point of common coupling;distributed control algorithm;hierarchical droop control,,1,29,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, cognition can be already viewed as a requirement for hyper-connected environments e.g., the factories of the future or the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, there is a need to represent and store the data collected from machines in a format that can be understood and manipulated by both humans and machines. This is feasible by designing and implementing semantic models i.e., ontologies which, in turn, enable inferring implicit data of explicit knowledge, leading to cognition. Moreover, there is a need of granting the access to such information remotely and at system runtime.

A distinctive feature of the presented survey is its focus on new versions of the VRP, which have recently emerged or gained momentum, and the corresponding new solution methods, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence (CI) approaches. The list of newly proposed or currently popular VRP formulations include last mile and same day delivery, crowdshipping, bike sharing systems, post-disaster response plans, local routing in large production or cargo plants, customer-centric VRP, autonomous delivery, unnamed aerial vehicle delivery, green VRP, waste collection VRP, rich VRP, or VRP with backhauls. Simultaneously, an adequate increase of interest in the application of traditional CI methods (e.g., genetic, memetic, ant colony or particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, or their various hybrid versions) can be observed in the VRP domain. At the same time, approaches proven efficient in other optimization areas (e.g., hyperheuristics, methods based on Monte Carlo simulations, algorithms rooted in game theory and bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games, or cognitively motivated methods) have lately entered the VRP field and become a viable alternative to more traditional techniques. Since VRP is one of the fastest growing fields in the operations research area, we believe that an analysis of the recently published VRP papers from the perspective of their novelty in problem formulation and/or applied solution method can provide a true value for the CI community, especially young researchers entering the field and seeking challenges in this interesting and fast developing research area.",2471-285X,,10.1109/TETCI.2018.2886585,Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591961,Computational intelligence;vehicle routing;combinatorial optimization;metaheuristics,Loading;Vehicle routing;Vehicle dynamics;Computational intelligence;Routing;Transportation;Optimization,ant colony optimisation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cognitive systems;customer services;disasters;environmental factors;game theory;genetic algorithms;goods distribution;industrial plants;Monte Carlo methods;operations research;particle swarm optimisation;simulated annealing;vehicle routing,rich VRP;game theory;cognitively motivated methods;vehicle routing problem;computational intelligence solution methods;operations research;bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games;Monte Carlo simulations;hyperheuristics optimization;simulated annealing;particle swarm optimization;ant colony optimization;genetic algorithm;memetic algorithm;autonomous delivery;cargo plants;production plants;bike sharing systems;crowdshipping;last mile delivery;same day delivery;waste collection VRP;green VRP;unnamed aerial vehicle delivery;customer-centric VRP;post-disaster response plans,,,156,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

The Torque Distribution Analysis for Dual Motor - Single Shaft Electric Drive,A. Hajduga,"Warsaw University of Technology, Narbutta 84, Warsaw, 02-524",2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR),,2018,,,622,627,"The application of multispeed gearbox in pure electric drive gives a significant benefit in electric energy consumption saving. It is visible, especially in the case of city exploitation conditions of the electric vehicle. Independent on the kind of use multispeed transmission its application in pure electric drive required its automated operation, both for vehicle acceleration and deceleration. In the case of Automated Manual Transmission the disadvantage is interrupted driving torque during gear shifting. This negative feature can be removed thanks to the proper drive train structure. One of them is proposed dual motor - single shaft drive structure. It consists of two electric motors. One of them is connected to the multispeed transmission input while the second is connected to the multispeed transmission output shaft and then to the final drive. This way of electric motor arrangement in electric drive structure puts together the benefits of multi speed gearbox application as well as the possibility of vehicles propelling during gear shifting. Additionally, compared to the classic electric drive structure with multispeed transmission, each motor rated power can be limited because the total drive power is the sum of both the motor powers. It is resulting in motors current limitation thus the same the losses are also limited and the drive efficiency increase. It seems that the effect on energy saving can be greater when both motors cooperate together in the proper way. This cooperation depends on both motor torque distribution. The motor torque distribution must be done under best efficiency motor operation condition. In the paper the analyses of the torque distribution influence on efficiency and battery power for the proposed structure of electric drive was done. There was proposed the definition of torque distribution based on the required output torque demand.

The intensity integral (C) in the upper cladding can be controlled by varying the thickness (HSi) of the top silicon layer. The highest evanescent field ratio of 0.85 is obtained at HSi=200 nm which allows the hybrid mode to confine in the low index medium and a large evanescent field resides in the upper cladding. The sensitivity of the waveguide is calculated by monitoring the change in the effective refractive index to the ambient refractive index. The maximum mode sensitivity of 0.7 is obtained. The spectral performance of the subwavelength grating (SWG) hybrid plasmonic waveguide (HPWG) based ring resonator design is studied which exhibits a sensitivity as high as 1000 nm/RIU which is higher than the previously reported values.

In order to do that, the article proposes a simple model of a timber log and its sawing procedure, solves a set of packing and stock cutting problems with the usage of a Particle Swarm Optimization based algorithm, and promotes a publicly available benchmark data set for the solved problem. In this article a problem of packing a set of rectangular shapes into a circular containers is formulated and solved with the usage of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, one-dimensional solutions dictionary and a greedy insertion heuristic for two-dimensional problem. The optimization problem is motivated by the sawn timber production and models the process of cutting out a stock of sawn timber out of the sets of tree logs. Proposed algorithm provides results of a stable quality with a reasonably high yield (low material waste). Quality of results obtained for different user parameter settings gives also some insight about the trade-off between the value of produced stock, material loss, number of created product types and possible production process costs (which are related to the number of allowed rotations of the input source material).",,978-1-5386-2726-6,10.1109/SSCI.2017.8280900,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8280900,,Dictionaries;Optimization;Minimization;Search problems;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Particle swarm optimization,bin packing;particle swarm optimisation;sawing;timber,simple model;timber log;sawing procedure;publicly available benchmark data set;one-dimensional solutions dictionary;greedy insertion heuristic;two-dimensional problem;optimization problem;sawn timber production;tree logs;theoretical packing;strictly practical aspects;timber sawing;particle swarm optimization algorithm;particle swarm optimization based algorithm;rectangles-in-circle packing,,,18,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Such extraction is usually performed by an optimization algorithm seeking device-parameter values that minimize the difference between the measured response and its simulated equivalent. The proposed approach needs only an average of 13 objective-function evaluations, i.e. device simulations, to extract three parameters of a single device. If the parameters of a group of devices of the same type are to be extracted, the average number of simulations drops to four per device. This number is much smaller than in conventional optimization procedures.

Dual Motor Single Shaft Powertrain Concept,A. Hajduga,"Warsaw University of Technology, Narbutta 84, Warsaw, 02-524",2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR),,2018,,,843,848,"Most of the modern electric vehicles (EV's) are not equipped with additional transmission that allows to set a different value of mechanical ratio. The redundancy of multispeed transmission application necessity is a result of very good electric motor (EM) torque speed characteristic. On the other hands, the changeable mechanical ratio allows to adjust in the best way the operational parameters of EM to momentary load on the vehicle wheels. This feature, in consequence, results in total drive efficiency increasing, so in the same time the energy consumption decreasing. The use of multispeed transmission in pure electric drive required its automated operation. There are many kinds of mechanical transmission that may be adopted to electric drive. One of them is Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). The advantage of mentioned transmission is relatively simple construction and way of operation as well as its lower price compared to other transmissions. However, its disadvantage is the EM interrupted operation during gear shifting. This disadvantage can be removed thanks to the proper drive train structure. One of them seems to be dual motor - single shaft drive powertrain. This structure consists of two electric motors and one multispeed transmission. One of EMs is connected to the multispeed transmission input shaft while the second is connected to the multispeed transmission output shaft and then to the final drive. This way of electric motor arrangement in electric drive structure brings together the benefits of multispeed transmission application and the possibility of vehicle propelling during gear shifting. The smooth and seamless operation of electric powertrain during gear shifting requires a proper way of both EMs control. The control strategy for gear shifting will be defined and verified using the computer simulations.",,978-1-5386-4325-9,10.1109/MMAR.2018.8485871,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485871,electric drive;transmission;gear shifting;EV,Gears;Torque;Shafts;Mechanical power transmission;Synchronization;Energy management;Wheels,electric drives;electric motors;electric vehicles;gears;power transmission (mechanical);shafts;torque;wheels,gear shifting;electric powertrain;modern electric vehicles;vehicle wheels;pure electric drive;mechanical transmission;Manual Transmission;single shaft drive powertrain;electric motors;multispeed transmission input shaft;multispeed transmission output shaft;electric drive structure;electric motor;energy consumption;drive train structure;dual motor single shaft powertrain,,,14,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

However, fields such as computational statistics, data analysis, and geometry usually emphasize the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each other. Nevertheless, in this paper, we show that, in the multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of orthomonotonicity.

Z oo, Warsaw, Poland; Innogy Stoen Operator Sp. z oo, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,,2020,35,2,600,608,"There has been a growing demand of electric power in many urban agglomerations. To address this demand, 110-kV power networks are regularly expanded inside and around cities in Poland. These power networks are often constructed as underground cable lines. The 110-kV cable lines are usually designed as three single-core cables laid in a common route. In case of long 110-kV cable lines, the cross-bonding method is applied to the connection of metal sheaths of these cables. Additionally, one or more earth continuity conductors are laid along the main cable line and earthed at both their ends. These earth continuity conductors can be uninsulated and can cause electric shock hazard (danger step voltages). The problem defined in this paper consists of an attempt to calculate the expected step voltages for different considered earth continuity conductor arrangements in 110-kV cable lines and to compare the obtained results to admissible values of the voltages found in an appropriate standard. Protection against electric shock, calculation of earthing resistance, and step voltages, as well as simulation studies in case of sample 110-kV cable lines have been described in the paper. The results show the analyzed layouts of 110-kV cable lines have significant impact on the values of voltages occurring in and around earth continuity conductors. The maximum values of earth electrode voltage (and in this way expected touch voltages), as well as step voltages occur in the layout of single cable line and single earth continuity conductor arranged in parallel.",1937-4208,,10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2916890,RWE; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715671,Power cable lines;earth continuity conductors electric shock protection;step voltage,Power cables;Grounding;Cable shielding;Earth;Conductors;Electric shock;Electrodes,cable sheathing;conductors (electric);earth electrodes;electric shocks;power cables;power transmission protection;underground cables,110 kV cable lines;power networks;underground cable lines;three single-core cables;electric shock hazard;single cable line;electric power;urban agglomerations;Poland;cross-bonding method;metal sheaths;step voltages;appropriate standard;system protection;earthing resistance;earth electrode voltage;single earth continuity conductor arrangements;voltage 110.0 kV,,,28,IEEE,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Mazurek,"Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Communications Letters,,2018,22,1,117,120,"The use of ultrasound in air as a means of digital communications has been demonstrated in recent years. Due to electromagnetic compatibility, privacy, and security issues, this kind of transmission fits the requirements of many medical applications, body-area networks, and general wireless short-range systems, where the transmission takes place in a single room with the distance up to 10 m. In the literature, different models of airborne ultrasound transmission have been investigated, but not supported by discussion of the channel theoretical capacity. On the other hand, knowledge of this measure is essential in the design of an efficient communication link and allows identifying its potential areas of applications. In this letter, we calculate estimates of the Shannon limit for five different configurations of airborne ultrasound digital communication channels. Our evaluation is based on the numerical results available in the literature. The obtained estimates show that in case of systems with multichannel transmission and higher order modulation schemes, the achieved data rates are closest to theoretical boundaries, but still further work is needed in order to achieve more efficient data transmission in airborne ultrasound communication channels.",1558-2558,,10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2768034,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8089735,Air-coupled ultrasound;digital communication;Shannon limit;channel capacity,Channel capacity;Bandwidth;Ultrasonic imaging;Acoustics;Transducers;Signal to noise ratio;OFDM,acoustic communication (telecommunication);body area networks;channel capacity;data communication;digital communication;electromagnetic compatibility;OFDM modulation;piezoelectric transducers;ultrasonic transmission;wireless channels,channel capacity;short-range ultrasonic communications;digital communications;electromagnetic compatibility;body-area networks;general wireless short-range systems;airborne ultrasound transmission;airborne ultrasound digital communication channels;multichannel transmission;airborne ultrasound communication channels;Shannon limit,,2,28,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally such systems are presented in transfer function or state matrices forms, the second one being especially convenient for computation with tools such as MATLAB environment. The problem with such approach arises when very large number of forms of dynamic system need to be compared and analysed, as finding similarities and properties is time-consuming or outright impossible due to computational complexity problems. Due to such limitations it is impossible to analyse all possible solutions for given dynamic systems and determine their usability. As solution to such problem alternative approach is proposed, where all possible representations of dynamic system are created using fast GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processor Units) compatible algorithm and stored in the form of directed graphs (digraphs). Creating efficient database architecture for storage of large number (numbering in millions) of such graphs in graph-based database like Neo4j allows us to efficiently analyse a whole set of solutions to find similarities, hidden properties and limitations, while at the same time retaining the ability to store the obtained data for further analysis (especially of more complicated systems) and expand the solution size, efficiently building new solutions on base of simpler solutions stored in the database.",,978-1-5386-4762-2,10.1109/CarpathianCC.2018.8399605,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399605,graph databases;Neo4j;dynamic systems;database architecture;NoSQL;GPGPU,Mathematical model;Transfer functions;Computer architecture;NoSQL databases;Heuristic algorithms;Matlab,computational complexity;database management systems;directed graphs;graph theory;matrix algebra,transfer function;dynamic system need;computational complexity problems;directed graphs;complicated systems;dynamic systems;general-purpose computing;database architecture;graph-based database;state matrices,,,22,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,

Energy-Optimal Data Aggregation and Dissemination for the Internet of Things,E. Fitzgerald; M. Pióro; A. Tomaszwski,"Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; Institute of Telecommunications, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,2018,5,2,955,969,"Established approaches to data aggregation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) do not cover the variety of new use cases developing with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the current push toward fog computing, in which control, computation, and storage are moved to nodes close to the network edge, induces a need to collect data at multiple sinks, rather than the single sink typically considered in WSN aggregation algorithms. Moreover, for machine-to-machine communication scenarios, actuators subscribing to sensor measurements may also be present, in which case data should be not only aggregated and processed in-network but also disseminated to actuator nodes. In this paper, we present mixed-integer programming formulations and algorithms for the problem of energy-optimal routing and multiple-sink aggregation, as well as joint aggregation and dissemination, of sensor measurement data in IoT edge networks. We consider optimization of the network for both minimal total energy usage, and min-max per-node energy usage. We also provide a formulation and algorithm for throughput-optimal scheduling of transmissions under the physical interference model in the pure aggregation case. We have conducted a numerical study to compare the energy required for the two use cases, as well as the time to solve them, in generated network scenarios with varying topologies and between 10 and 40 nodes. Although aggregation only accounts for less than 15% of total energy usage in all cases tested, it provides substantial energy savings. Our results show more than 13 times greater energy usage for 40-node networks using direct, shortest-path flows from sensors to actuators, compared with our aggregation and dissemination solutions.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2803792,"National Science Centre, Poland, “Packet routing and transmission scheduling optimization in multi-hop wireless networks with multicast traffic”; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8286885,Aggregation;fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT);mixed-integer programming (MIP);sensor networks,Data aggregation;Actuators;Logic gates;Optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Data models;Internet of Things,integer programming;Internet of Things;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks,energy-optimal data aggregation;wireless sensor networks;fog computing;network edge;multiple sinks;WSN aggregation algorithms;machine-to-machine communication scenarios;sensor measurements;mixed-integer programming formulations;energy-optimal routing;multiple-sink aggregation;sensor measurement data;IoT edge networks;minimal total energy usage;pure aggregation case;generated network scenarios;actuator nodes;min-max per-node energy usage;throughput-optimal scheduling,,14,44,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,
Marking the Allophones Boundaries Based on the DTW Algorithm,J. Rafałko,"Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland","2018 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",,2018,,,245,249,"The paper presents an approach to marking the boundaries of allophones in the speech signal based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. Setting and marking of allophones boundaries in continuous speech is a difficult issue due to the mutual influence of adjacent phonemes on each other. It is this neighbourhood on the one hand that creates variants of phonemes that is allophones, and on the other hand it affects that the border between allophones is in some cases very difficult to determine. Nowadays, this task is carried out manually in cooperation with specialists in the field of phonetics. The presented approach allows to build a system that is able to automate this process. The aim of the work currently carried out by the author is a method that facilitates the training material processing for the needs of the development of multimodal speech recognition systems. For this purpose, the difficult problem of marking boundaries of allophones is solved in this report based on the Polish dictionary in the context of the creation of allophone bases for speech synthesis. This is done in this way due to the simplified possibility of organizing critical listening and subjective evaluation of received allophones by a large group of Polish native speakers (73 people). Strengthening the method will allow it to be used for the extraction of allophones for the needs of developed system of automatic transcription of English speech and for its notation according to the IPA standard. The analysed continuous speech is combined in the DTW algorithm with a synthesized speech signal. The comparison of both signals is performed not in the time domain as in the classical DTW, but in the frequency domain. This allows for a statement that the phonetic content of both signals is compared. The paper describes the process of marking the boundaries of allophones for the Polish language, however after appropriate modifications, this approach can be used to determine the allophones boundaries in other languages, especially for English.",2326-0319,978-8-3620-6533-2,10.23919/SPA.2018.8563359,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8563359,allophoneme analysis;speech processing;Dynamic Time Warping,Databases;Acoustics;Phonetics;Heuristic algorithms;Speech synthesis;Speech recognition,natural language processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis,allophones boundaries;DTW algorithm;multimodal speech recognition systems;allophone bases;speech synthesis;received allophones;English speech;synthesized speech signal;dynamic time warping algorithm;continuous speech analysis,,,15,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,
Virtual Torque and Power Control of a Three-Phase Converter Connected to an Unbalanced Grid With Consideration of Converter Current Constraint and Operation Mode,G. Iwanski,"Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warszawa, Poland",IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,,2019,34,4,3804,3818,"The paper presents a three-phase power converter control under grid voltage imbalance. The proposed method adapts the current imbalance in relation to the inverter or rectifier operation. Under the inverter operation, the control target is to have the nonoscillatory p component of instantaneous power and the xv component of instantaneous virtual torque calculated as the dot product of the grid virtual flux vector and the converter current vector. Then, the phase with lower voltage is supported by higher current. In the rectifier mode, the control target is to have the nonoscillatory q component of power and the Tv component of virtual torque calculated as the cross product of the virtual flux and the converter current. This way, the phase with the highest voltage is loaded by higher current. Unbalanced current obtained in both targets is limited in the way that allows us to limit true phase current and retain sinusoidal current waveforms. However, it does not allow maximum power transfer at the given grid voltage asymmetry, so in order to increase the power value, current progressive balancing is proposed in both operation modes. Finally, converter current balancing is applied also in the case in which a significant amount of reactive power is referenced.",1941-0107,,10.1109/TPEL.2018.2850014,Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395041,AC–DC power conversion;current control;current limiters;power control;torque control,Torque;Rectifiers;Inverters;TV;Oscillators;Voltage control;Reactive power,electric current control;machine control;power control;power convertors;power grids;reactive power control;rectifiers;torque control,grid virtual flux vector;converter current vector;rectifier mode;phase current;sinusoidal current waveforms;maximum power transfer;power value;current progressive balancing;operation modes;converter current balancing;reactive power;power control;three-phase converter;unbalanced grid;converter current constraint;three-phase power converter control;grid voltage imbalance;current imbalance;inverter operation;grid voltage asymmetry;nonoscillatory component;dot product;instantaneous virtual torque;instantaneous power,,,24,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, constraints of important states and control variables are a posteriori introduced into control algorithm to provide satisfactory dynamic behaviour and safe operation of the plant. The boundary values of control signals which provide permissible values of the future state-space variables are derived from the models of power converters that take into account two modes of operation (i.e. charging and discharging mode). The novelty of the proposed approach lies in efficient control algorithm that utilises the gain-scheduled SFC with the parameter-dependent constraint handling method. The designed control algorithm is extensively tested through simulation and experiments at a switching frequency of 36 kHz.

Krupiński,"Electrical Power Engineering Institute Lighting Technology Division, Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Warsaw, Poland",2018 VII. Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4),,2018,,,1,5,"The article presents a solution to the problem of work and time consuming of the objects floodlighting projects creation. Currently, the only technically correct methods for creating such projects are a three-dimensional computer simulation using photometric files of luminaires or field trials using real equipment. Both of these methods have their advantages, but also many disadvantages. Among architects, in turn, a popular method of floodlighting designing is graphic processing of daytime or evening images objects. The method is relatively fast and it gives photorealistic effects but it is technically incorrect. An architect or graphic designer creates a picture that is attractive to the eye, but usually has nothing to do with reality. This is due to the fact that the lighting parameters of both lighting equipment and analyzing this type of project in terms of technology are not taken into account. The article presents a solution to this problem. It describes a system created especially for this purpose based on a dedicated computer application that allows simulation of the object floodlighting using its daily photograph. This is technically correct simulation, because it uses photometric files of luminaires. The system allows correction of basic photometric parameters: editing of photometric files, luminous flux, light in different directions, color temperature and the use of color filters. The computer application also enables photo editing, geometric correction, measurement and defining reflection and transmission properties of materials from which the object is actually built.

Scalar weighting factors, which are generally used in classic direct model predictive control (CDMPC), are difficult to select. Studies over weighting factor elimination is therefore of considerable significance.

By envisaging two different operational modes of our system, and by employing a DCNN-based classifiers fine-tuned with a dataset of real and fake hand representations captured in both visible and thermal spectrum, we were able to bring two important deliverables. First, a PAD method operating in an open-set mode, capable of correctly discerning 100% of fake thermal samples, achieving Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) and Bona-Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER) equal to 0%, which can be easily implemented into any existing system as a separate component. Second, a hand biometrics system operating in a closed-set mode, that has PAD built right into the recognition pipeline, and operating simultaneously with the user-wise classification, achieving rank-1 recognition accuracy of up to 99.75%. We also show that thermal images of the human hand, in addition to liveness features they carry, can also improve classification accuracy of a biometric system, when coupled with visible light images.

Model Predictive Control of High Power Converters and Industrial Drives [Book News],M. P. Kazmierkowski,"Warsaw University of Technology, Poland",IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine,,2018,12,3,55,56,"Conventionally, power electronic converters and drives have been controlled by linear single-nput, single-output control loops. Particularly for high-power converters with multiple coupled dynamics and tight operating constraints, model predictive control (MPC) is expected to evolve into the control method of choice. MPC allows one to increase lower the current distortions, reduce the converter hardware, achieve very fast transient responses, and ensure the reliable operation within safe operating area constraints. The first six chapters of this book offer a three phase power electronics, electrical machines, carrier-based pulsewidth modulation, optimized pulse patterns, state-of-the-art art converter control methods, and the principle of MPC. Chapters 7-14 include an in-depth treatment of MPC methods that fully exploit the performance potential of high-power converters. These control methods combine the fast control responses of deadbeat control with the optimal steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns by resolving the antagonism between the two. Each chapter is supplemented with an adequate well-selected list of recent references at the end. This is a well-written and richly illustrated text achieving a balance between mathematical rigor and physical insight.
