We want to present a spatial spin-wave modulator (SSM), allowing engineering of a spatial phase of spin-waves stored in a cold atomic memory. Using the SLM and polarizers we are able to shape a laser beam into an arbitrary shape. Such a prepared beam illuminates a cold rubidium cloud and due to ac-Stark effect the spatial phase of stored spin-waves is modified. The relative standard deviation of phase given by our SSM amounts to about 10%. We have also shown that losses scale quadratically with given phase. On one hand, that strongly limits the efficiency of SSM for strong phase modulation, but on the other hand enables efficient modulation in small range of several radians. During our research we have demonstrated a compensation of the quadratic phase introduced by a cylindrical lens placed in a readout path of our quantum memory. Moreover, introducing more complicated shapes of the ac-Stark beam, like saw or sine shape, we can shift and split spin-waves in Fourier domain [1]. Therefore we were able to interfere spin-waves stored in different spatial and temporal modes. This makes our SSM very robust tool which in conjugation with gradient echo memory can potentially allow to implement some new quantum protocols [2]. Finally, going to the single photon level we successfully observed a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two spin-waves stored in different spatial modes of our memory [3].","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8871589","","Phase modulation;Shape;Laser beams;Optics;Phase measurement;Rubidium","laser beams;lenses;light interference;optical modulation;optical storage;phase modulation;quantum optics;rubidium;spatial light modulators;spin waves;Stark effect","cylindrical lens;Hong-Ou-Mandel interference;single photon level;strong phase modulation;cold atomic memory;spatial phase;spatial light modulators;highly-multimode memories;multimode cold rubidium quantum memory;spatial spin-wave modulator;gradient echo memory;temporal modes;ac-Stark beam;quadratic phase;Rb","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Until 5 July 2016, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 17 729 artificial objects including 1419 operational satellites[1]. Information about the current position of these objects should be taken into consideration while planning space missions. There are various solutions to cope with the problem considered. The main objective was to design a low-cost system that would detect objects which do not emit their own signal and can cause collision with spacecrafts. The reception system is based on Doppler detection. One of the methods of gathering information about space objects which are changing their position relatively to the Earth is using the continuous wave reflection. The reflected outgoing sinusoidal wave is Doppler-shifted to higher or lower frequency according to whether it has a line of sight velocity towards or away from the receiver. It is also common to use this method for meteor detection. In this project we use signal emitted by the Graves Radar. Graves is a French radar-based space surveillance system which transmitter is located in the east of France and generates continuous wave with a frequency 143,05 MHz. In order to receive the reflected signal we built the passive radar which works on frequency similar to Graves. It is located 15 km to the south of Warsaw centre, thanks to its position it is possible to avoid radio noise coming from the city. Our construction includes directional antenna designed for 144 MHz and FUNcube Dongle Pro+. The FUNcube Dongle Pro+ is a software-defined radio (SDR) covering all broadcast andamateur radio bands from 150 kHz to 1,9 GHz. We use Orbitron as a software. Orbitron is an application related to satellite tracking. We can predict what kind of data will we receive from our construction by verifying it in application. Our first tests of the system were performed on objects with a well known trajectory and velocity. Also a correlation with data from two-line element set (TLE) was made. TLE is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time. Results show spectrogram of a signal reflected from satellite with a Doppler shift that fits our expectations. The flying object generated a Doppler shift of about 10 kHz below the carrier frequency. Although the first data come from objects with a large size and mass above 1 ton, in further observations we expect to receive reflection from satellites which mass is less than 10 kg.","","978-1-5090-6755-8","10.1109/SPS.2017.8053660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053660","","Satellites;Orbits;Extraterrestrial measurements;Radar tracking;Satellite broadcasting","artificial satellites;directive antennas;Doppler shift;passive radar;radar antennas;satellite tracking;software radio;space debris;spaceborne radar","space debris;United States Strategic Command;space missions;low-cost system;reception system;Doppler detection;continuous wave reflection;meteor detection;Graves Radar;passive radar;frequency similar;Warsaw centre;radio noise;broadcast andamateur radio bands;satellite tracking;two-line element set;orbital elements;Earth-orbiting object;Doppler shift;flying object;carrier frequency;LEO satellites;space object detection;French radar-based space surveillance system;directional antenna;FUNcube Dongle Pro+;software-defined radio;SDR;frequency 10.0 kHz;frequency 150.0 kHz to 19.0 GHz;frequency 144.0 MHz","","1","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accelerator subsystems are operating at frequencies of 352 MHz and 704 MHz.

The main part of the phase reference distribution system is a Phase Reference Line (PRL), which is a fully passive system based on a single 1-5/8” coaxial rigid line placed along the tunnel. The PRL was designed to distribute both reference frequencies from a Master Oscillator to 56 tap points in the tunnel. Each tap point has several (3 or 6) signal outputs. The total length of the PRL is around 580 meters and the total number of signal outputs equals 294. To achieve the best drift performance and fulfill ESS synchronization requirements, the PRL will be equipped with temperature stabilization system (+/-0.1 oC) and with an internal gas pressure stabilization system.

The nanostructurization opens new opportunities for development of fibres with a core composed of glasses doped with active or photosensitive ions.

In this work we present and discuss our solutions of photonic integrated interrogators for application in a novel fiber-optic sensing system, dedicated to monitoring condition of a patient exposed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning procedure. The monitoring system makes use of multiple fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based sensors, which offer the advantages of high sensitivity and immunity to strong magnetic fields and simultaneously do not affect the results of an MRI scan. Furthermore, the fact that many gratings can be inscribed within a single optical fiber simplifies the architecture of the sensing network. Basically, two main approaches to interrogate FBG-based sensors can be distinguished. The first uses a broadband optical signal, which is coupled into the fiber-optic sensing network, while the reflected spectrum is monitored using a spectrometer, typically equipped with a number of detectors. In the second approach a monochromatic, wavelength-swept light is used to scan the sensors and the reflected signal is detected using a single photodetector. The solutions presented and discussed in this work are based on the first approach and make use of generic technology of photonic integration It should be noted that the majority of commercially available photonic interrogators are realized in a form of bulky devices, consisting of a number of discrete optoelectronics components. That is why they have significant disadvantages: relatively large dimensions, bulky design and considerable power consumption. On the contrary, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer compact design, energy efficiency, high reliability as well as reduced fabrication and packaging costs. In our research we are trying to benefit from all these features. In this work we present and discuss the properties of a test series of integrated interrogators manufactured using generic InP technology [1] and differing in details of design and the number of wavelength channels available. R&D works enabled comparison of the performance parameters of all devices and, finally, determination of the most promising solution, based on 36-channel arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) with 75 GHz and 50 GHz channel spacing, shown in Fig. 1. The photonic integrated chip shown comprises two interrogators, both equipped with two optical inputs - one with built-in semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and the second without SOA. A series of experiments that was carried out confirmed design assumptions. Fabricated structures with 50 GHz and 75 GHz AWG have 0.4 nm (Fig lb) and 0.6 nm channel spacings and free spectral ranges (FSR) 14.4 mu and 21.6 nm respectively, as designed. Furthermore, application of the built-in SOA appeared to increase signal by 10 dB, allowing interrogators working better with low-level input optical signals. The signal reflected from an FBG was reconstructed successfully by the interrogator. Finally, the Bragg wavelength shift due to strain applied to an FBG was reconstructed, demonstrating a possibility of monitoring the changes of strain induced on the sensors on the MRI bed, which is a result of the patient's breath movements.","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8873399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873399","","Fiber gratings;Photonics;Optical fiber sensors;Arrayed waveguide gratings;Semiconductor optical amplifiers","biomedical MRI;Bragg gratings;fibre optic sensors;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics","breath movement;MRI bed;low-level input optical signal;photonic integrated chip;arrayed waveguide gratings;generic InP technology;photonic integrated circuits;single photodetector;spectrometer;reflected spectrum;broadband optical signal;fiber optic sensor networks;sensing network;single optical fiber;MRI scan;strong magnetic fields;multiple fiber Bragg grating based sensors;monitoring system;magnetic resonance imaging scanning procedure;monitoring condition;fiber-optic sensing system;photonic integrated interrogators","","","1","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The gain of each generated beam is similar because different numbers of slots are opened, i.e., three, five, and nine slots for beams directed toward 0°, 30°, and 45°, respectively.

The solutions used by many countries, including France and the United States are complex as well as expensive. The aim of the project in question was to establish an affordable and simple radar-based surveillance system allowing to detect, track and catalogue objects in the outer space. The main elements used were: a Yagi antenna with proper equipment as a Doppler-shifted signal receiver, two programs for raw data analysis and orbit fitting as well as a database containing information about detected satellites. Basing on the frequency of signals emitted by the Graves radar, an object orbit estimation was made using a C++ program and then stored in a database. The phenomenon of relativistic Doppler effect was considered while analysing the data. The amplitude of signal gave the frequency as function of time. Next, a circular orbit approximation was found and saved to the database. On average 1176 satellite flights have been registered every week so far. The total cost of the system did not exceed €430, whereas the whole ESA's Space Situational Awareness Programme needs a budget of €95 million. It was possible to create a low-cost and uncomplicated part of a SSA system. The last and only functionality left is object identification by its cross section, which is planned to be developed in the near future.","","978-83-949421-1-3","10.23919/MIKON.2018.8405229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405229","space surveillance;satellites;orbits;radar tracking","Orbits;Satellites;Space vehicles;Spaceborne radar;Radar tracking;Databases","Doppler radar;object detection;object tracking;search radar;spaceborne radar","radar-based surveillance system;object identification;relativistic Doppler effect;object orbit estimation;Graves radar;Doppler-shifted signal receiver;Yagi antenna;space situational awareness programmes;Earth orbit;space debris;cataloguing system","","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the first process is more expensive in computational complexity sense, the overall computational complexity can be decrease by reducing the number of estimation of the ground clutter. One of the option is estimate the clutter not for each coherent processing intervals, but only for selected intervals. The side effect of this is ability of detection the moving objects at zero-Doppler bean, as they appears only in that bean for short time.The paper shows the analyses of ground clutter stability and impact of instability for clutter cancelation without current estimation.

A very wide range of applications such as data storage, photolithography, medical diagnostics and sterilization motivates research and development on new active materials which can efficiently emit light in the UV spectral range. There are three general methods to achieve UV and visible light emission. The first are semiconductor-based LEDs and laser diodes - in the recent years a rapid progress in the field of semiconductor lasers has been observed resulting in a variety of commercially available short-wavelength laser diodes. These impressive devices, however, are not free from some disadvantages, like poor quality of the beam and limited output power. That's why other sources continue to attract researchers' attention. The second method deploys nonlinear crystals, which enable obtaining short wavelength emission by the frequency multiplication. The third way to achieve UV and visible light is to directly use the optical transitions within rare earth ions in solid state media [1-2]. This work is focused on this last method.","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8871946","","Luminescence;Semiconductor lasers;Glass;Laser excitation;Fiber lasers;Pump lasers","aluminium compounds;holmium;laser transitions;light emitting diodes;light sources;optical materials;optical pumping;photolithography;photoluminescence;semiconductor lasers;ultraviolet sources","short-wavelength laser diodes;impressive devices;limited output power;short wavelength emission;UV luminescence;ho:ZBLAN;short-wavelength lasers;coherent light sources;data storage;photolithography;medical diagnostics;sterilization;active materials;UV spectral range;general methods;visible light emission;semiconductor-based LEDs;semiconductor lasers","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant mortality and morbidity is related to occurrence of AF arrhythmia due to high risk of hospitalization, stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease, etc. In many cases AF may not produce any symptoms and may go unnoticed by a patient, which is why there is a high importance to develop methods of detecting this heart disorder. Creating an algorithm for AF and other arrhythmias classification of short-term single lead ECG signals was the aim of the PhysioNet Challenge 2017. The database was composed by over 8.5 thousand ECG recordings (between 10 sec and 60 sec length) measured by AliveCor device, provided by organizers. We prepared an alternative hybrid approach for QRS detection in order to obtain RR time intervals. It consists of two complementary methods in hierarchical order: one based on nonlinear transformation and first-order Gaussian differentiator as superior and another one proposed in sample entry as inferior. We introduce the machine learning algorithm in order to classify whether it is normal sinus rhythm, AF or an alternative heart rhythm using features considered regularity of RR time intervals and morphology of the ECG signal. The separate part of the algorithm based on beat averaging method is dedicated for preceding extraction of too noisy recordings from the input to the classifier. The best overall F1 score we achieved in the official phase of the PhysioNet Challenge 2017 was 0.77 (0.86 for normal, 0.78 for AF and 0.66 for other rhythms).","2325-887X","978-1-5386-6630-2","10.22489/CinC.2017.337-201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331731","","Rhythm;Electrocardiography;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Morphology;Standards","blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal detection","atrial fibrillation;short-term ECG recordings;hybrid QRS detection;morbidity;AF arrhythmia;heart failure;coronary artery disease;heart disorder;arrhythmias classification;short-term single lead ECG signals;alternative hybrid approach;RR time intervals;complementary methods;hierarchical order;nonlinear transformation;machine learning algorithm;alternative heart rhythm;ECG signal;beat averaging method;sustained cardiac arrhythmia;first-order Gaussian differentiator;AliveCor device;time 10 s to 60 s","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following promising results of numerical simulations [2], we performed an experimental study in the 1500-1900 nm spectral range by using a tunable ultrafast laser source generating 70-fs pulses at a few μJ energy level. Continuous control of attenuation and polarization direction of the input field was ensured under separate excitation of a single fiber core, made of the low index glass with an effective mode area of 1.73 μm2 at 1500 nm. The dual-core cladding is made of high index glass including the 1.4-μm gap between the two cores. The series of camera pictures, imaging the output facet of the dual-core fiber at different input pulse energies, indicated nonlinear switching at distinct excitation conditions. A change in the dominancy of the output core of 32 mm long DCF was registered when 1700 nm, 70 fs pulses with increasing energies in range of 100-300 pJ (measured before in-coupling optics) were launched into the fiber. Output spectra were registered separately for the two cores, when the nonlinear switching was observed according to the camera registrations. The spectra were processed by plotting the curves representing a ratio R(λ) of the spectral intensities of the two cores: R(λ) = St(λ)/Sb(λ) - 1, where St(λ) represent the spectra registered from the top core (dominant at low pulse energies) and Sb(λ) are the spectra originating from the bottom core (Fig. 1a). In Fig. 1b, the excitation energy dependence of R(λ) is depicted, with positive and negative values representing the cases of the dominancy of the top and the bottom cores, respectively. The spectra reflect the similar energy dependence as the series of camera images, shown in the insets of Fig. 1b. In the case of low excitation energy, the spectral intensity ratio curves reveal a dominancy of the top core, while at higher pulse energies a majority of launched pulse energy is located in the bottom core.

Among different fibre designs the most widely used is Coming's low dispersive SMF28, which has established a new standard in telecommunication industry. To be precise SMFs support two orthogonally polarized linear modes simultaneously. In an ideal circular-core fiber, these two modes will propagate with the same phase velocity. However, slight fabrication geometrical inaccuracies, bends or twists introduces small birefringence into the fiber. The magnitude of this birefringence keeps changing randomly with time due to fluctuations in the ambient conditions. Such instabilities in the output state of polarization might introduce bandwidth limiting polarisation mode dispersion and influences performance of polarization sensitive devices.","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8872353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8872353","","Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber sensors;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber polarization;Standards","bending;birefringence;fibre optic sensors;laser modes;light polarisation;optical fibre communication;optical fibre dispersion;optical fibre fabrication;optical fibre losses;optical fibre polarisation;optical fibre testing;optical fibres","telecommunication infrastructure;signal attenuation;long-distance network links;fibre designs;low dispersive SMF28;telecommunication industry;ideal circular-core fiber;bandwidth limiting polarisation mode dispersion;SMF28 standard;single mode fibres;building blocks;highly birefringent nanostructured core optical fiber;SMFs support two orthogonally polarized linear modes","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The detection and analysis of interictal and ictal epileptiform spikes is of major importance for identifying this area. The “irritative zone” of cortex with interictal spikes are usually revealed intraoperatively during acute electrocorticogram (ECoG). Since ECoG recordings cannot be completely visually reviewed in a reasonable amount of time, computer algorithms for automatic detection of seizures and spikes were developed.

For that purpose, a new scalar 1-D layered electromagnetic (EM) model of the resonator is proposed. The model takes the advantage of Cartesian-to-Gaussian coordinate transformation and axisymmetrical properties of the TEM modes of interest. There are several advantages of the proposed approach. The first is the use of Gaussian mirrors instead of spherical ones, which better fit to the shape of Gaussian wavefronts. Second, the model more accurately accounts for oblique incidence of the wave onto the surface of the sample, which is one of the major challenges in case of alternative models based on a characteristic equation. An automated measurement setup operating in the 20-50-GHz range has been designed and manufactured to experimentally validate the proposed measurement method. A real part of permittivity of a few well-known materials, such as silicon, quartz, polystyrene, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foil, has been measured with the accuracy better than 0.5%, which means a significant improvement as compared to the state of the art in this area.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2019.2905549","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680772","Conformal transformation (CT);dielectric properties;Fabry–Pérot open resonator (FPOR);measurement techniques;transfer matrix method (TMM)","Mirrors;Microwave measurement;Shape;Permittivity;Shape measurement;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty","Fabry-Perot resonators;mirrors;permittivity;permittivity measurement","low-loss dielectric materials;axisymmetrical properties;Gaussian wavefronts;oblique incidence;measurement method;complex permittivity;automated measurement setup;Fabry-Perot open resonator;concave Gaussian mirrors;scalar 1D layered electromagnetic model;Cartesian-Gaussian coordinate transformation;polyethylene terephthalate foil;frequency 20.0 GHz to 50.0 GHz;Si;SiO2","","3","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second application is related to the problem of creating proper decision rules which usually are present in System Dynamics models. In that case we substitute original decision rules by control variables and then define an optimal control problem whose performance index is used to verify the effectiveness of a particular decision rule. Having the solution of the optimal control problem we use it to modify the decision rule or its parameters.

The magnitude and phase of the reflection coefficient (S11 parameter) measured in the 0.1 ÷ 26 GHz frequency range are presented for undisturbed structures as well as for structures illuminated by white light and electrostatically polarized with the backgate. A simple and robust de-embedding procedure based on the signal flow graph and allowing for a simultaneous extraction of the parameters characterizing the CPW segment and the graphene monolayer is proposed. The graphene impedance at microwave frequencies is in good agreement with the value of dc sheet resistance obtained from van der Pauw measurements. The back-gate voltage modulation is an efficient way to modulate both the dc sheet resistance and the impedance. In particular, the Dirac point can be achieved both at microwave frequencies and at dc.

In this work, we introduce a method for harmonising service robot tasks being managed by finite state machines. The method allows for the handling of safe suspend and resume procedures for a complex task. Additionally, we consider a case when the robot can not switch the current task to another at any time.

The principle of the OTDR's operation is based on sending a series of light pulses and analyzing the returning optical signals resulting from the Rayleigh scattering and reflections from fiber connectors, splices etc. [1]. The main advantage of the OTDR technique is the ability to perform optical link diagnostics with access to a single end of the fiber only.

District heating systems should not be simply viewed as three distinct components - for more efficient operation pipelines, combined heat and power plants and customers should be linked by appropriate control structures. The paper contains an overview of the implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms in the various elements of a heating system and the wide spectrum of related issues. The implementation of algorithms for predictive maintenance and optimization of coal mills, coal combustion, or operation of the entire heat and power plant, with additional heat accumulation, are briefly discussed and described. Methods directly connected with the distribution network such as predictive maintenance of pipeline failures, forecasting of heat demand, network optimization and anomaly detection are also outlined.

These errors result primarily from the presence of a gap in the inner conductor. Our approach relies on an approximate model of the connector interface that comprises an analytical equivalent-circuit for the inner conductor gap section and a behavioral scattering-parameter model for the socket-contact section. We verify this model using full-wave electromagnetic simulations for the 1.85, 2.4, 3.5 mm, and Type-N coaxial-connector interface for different inner conductor-gap widths. We further apply this model to asses first-order errors in VNA calibration introduced by the tolerance on the inner conductor-gap width. We show that the inner conductor-gap effect can be accounted for with a series inductance inserted at the inner conductor mating-plane while the effect of the socket contact can be lumped into the VNA calibration coefficients. We verify this error model experimentally by measuring a Type-N offset load with an adjustable inner conductor gap. We also demonstrate that including our error model in coaxial offset-short definitions leads to improved consistency of a one-port VNA calibration with 3.5-mm coaxial offset-short standards. Our results can be used in the uncertainty analysis and accuracy enhancement of VNA scattering-parameter measurements.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2018.2885755","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8588299","Calibration;coaxial connector;error modeling;inner conductor gap;vector network analyzer (VNA)","Sockets;Conductors;Calibration;Contacts;Analytical models;Standards","approximation theory;calibration;conductors (electric);electric connectors;equivalent circuits;measurement errors;measurement uncertainty;network analysers;S-parameters","coaxial offset-short definitions;one-port VNA calibration;VNA scattering-parameter measurements;vector-network-analyzer measurements;approximate model;behavioral scattering-parameter model;socket-contact section;coaxial offset-short standards;first-order error assessment modeling;adjustable inner conductor-gap width section;analytical equivalent-circuit;full-wave electromagnetic simulations;Type-N coaxial-connector interface;measurement uncertainty;VNA calibration coefficients;inner conductor mating-plane;size 3.5 mm;size 2.4 mm;size 1.85 mm","","1","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Identification provides for three states (classes) of drill which were marked according to traffic lights classification: red - “useless” (worn out), yellow (still sharp but should be manually assessed by a specialist), green -“useful” (sharp). Red state indicates symptoms of drill worn out and determines that it should not be used during the drilling process (does not satisfy the furniture process quality). Yellow drill state should draw attention to the fact that the drill may be excessively blunt. Later on, it is recommended to assess the drill manually. When the system indicates the green state of drill, it means that the drill may still be used in the drilling process, maintaining the high quality of drill holes. The recognition of drill state is based on 5 registered signals: feed force, cutting torque, noise, vibration and acoustic emission. The hardest part in the implementation of automatic identification of drill condition is to find appropriate features, which will separate cases belonging to 3 classes (states). When input data are presented in the form of images, we can use the convolution neural network, but in that case we have signals registered as time series, hence the long-short term memory (LSTM) is applied.","","978-1-5386-7895-4","10.1109/CPEE.2018.8506809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8506809","deep learning;long short-term memory;tool condition monitoring;drill condition","Tools;Time series analysis;Training;Sensors;Testing;Classification algorithms;Vibrations","acoustic emission;acoustic noise;cutting;drilling;laminates;production engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;time series;vibrations;wear","automatic identification;drill condition;long-short term memory;drilling process;drill wear;yellow drill state;drill holes;standard laminated chipboard;LSTM;drill tear;drill state recognition;feed force;cutting torque;noise;vibration;acoustic emission;time series","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent years observed significant development of the technology of luminescent materials for application in light sources (both coherent and incoherent) operating in the visible part of the spectrum. Undoubtedly, the most spectacular results have been obtained in the field of wide bandgap semiconductor lasers, considerable progress has been also observed in solid state lasers based on crystalline or glassy hosts with frequency conversion. Despite this results, however, there is still a room for development of entirely new types of active media, like e.g. composite polymers doped with optically active nanocrystals. Such a materials may potentially benefit from excellent luminescent properties of RE3+ doped nanocrystals and good optical and thermo-mechanical properties of polymer matrices enabling drawing the optical fibers based on these composites. In such a design nanocrystalline environment provides the protection of active ions from interactions with highly energetic phonons of polymer matrix and simultaneously, polymer host encapsulating nanoparticles shields these from interactions with OH- groups and other contaminations. In this work we summarize the results of our research on design and development of the first PMMA-based optically active composite fiber, activated with rare-earth ions introduced in a form of active nanocrystals. The set of Tm3++Yb3+ doped nanocrystalline samples based on oxide and fluoride crystals of different dopant concentration was synthesized using precipitation method. All manufactured samples were carefully examined by means of classical optical spectroscopy - in particular excitation and emission spectra together with luminescence dynamic profiles have been recorded and analyzed with specific focus on up-conversion excitation schemes. The optimal pumping wavelengths were experimentally verified using a unique pressure tuned semiconductor laser diodes. For samples with optimal luminescent properties the bulk composites based on PMMA polymer doped with Tm3++Yb3+:YF3 nanocrystals were manufactured and carefully tested.","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8086668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086668","","Optical fibers;Plastics;Frequency conversion;Nanocrystals;Particle beam optics;Optical pumping","nanofabrication;nanoparticles;nanophotonics;optical fibre fabrication;optical frequency conversion;optical polymers;optical pumping;photoluminescence;polymer fibres;precipitation (physical chemistry);thulium;visible spectra;ytterbium;yttrium compounds","oxide crystals;fluoride crystals;dopant concentration;precipitation method;classical optical spectroscopy;excitation spectra;emission spectra;luminescence dynamic profiles;up-conversion excitation schemes;optimal pumping wavelengths;unique pressure tuned semiconductor laser diodes;optimal luminescent properties;bulk composites;PMMA polymer;Tm3++Yb3+:YF3 nanocrystals;Tm3++Yb3+ doped nanocrystalline samples;rare-earth ions;PMMA-based optically active composite fiber;polymer host encapsulating nanoparticles;polymer matrix;highly energetic phonons;active ions;nanocrystalline environment;optical fibers;polymer matrices;thermo-mechanical properties;optical properties;RE3+ doped nanocrystals;optically active nanocrystals;composite polymers;frequency conversion;glassy hosts;crystalline hosts;solid state lasers;wide bandgap semiconductor lasers;light sources;luminescent materials;VIS spectral range;polymer-based composite active fiber;YF3:Tm3+,Yb3+","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since ITO is electrically conductive and electrochemically active it can be used as a working electrode in 3-electrode cyclic voltammetry setup. For fixed potential applied to the electrode current flow decrease with time what corresponds to polymer layer formation on the ITO surface. Since LMR phenomenon depends on optical properties in proximity of the ITO surface, polymer layer formation can be monitored optically in real time.

For some instruments (e.g., the flute or the trombone) the sound exposure is asymmetrical, which means that the sound levels are different at the left and at the right ear. Such an exposure may cause an asymmetrical noise-induced hearing loss reflected by different noise induced permanent threshold shifts (NIPTS) in the left and in the right ear.

For this purpose, a system that allows searching for songs in a pre-prepared database using various pitch tracking methods was implemented. The system uses the hummed part of a song or recording of live singing as an input signal for which melodic contours are created. These contours are then compared with sample songs in the database.

The largest differences in IQE spectra measured between 100 and 300 K were observed in the wavelength range, corresponding to the light absorbed exclusively in the CIGS layer. Absorbers in the investigated cells were grown using a one-stage process. Since all elements are supplied at a constant rate, the obtained layers are free of the band gap grading, therefore collection in the bulk of the layer is not affected by a quasi-electrical field. This allows us to discuss temperature changes in collection solely in terms of recombination. We associate the change in IQE with recombination via defects present in the bulk of absorber. The two cases of donor and acceptor defects are discussed. Using SCAPS software and basic handbook formulas that describe the emission and capture rates of carriers, we estimate a range of basic parameters of the possible bulk defects in CIGS that are responsible for the temperature change of IQE spectra. Our results suggest that IQE may be controlled by shallow defects of ionization energy of 45 and 60 meV for the donor and acceptor cases, respectively. We calculate IQE spectra at different temperatures. The temperature change of simulated spectra reproduces the same tendency as experimental characteristics.","2156-3403","","10.1109/JPHOTOV.2018.2870527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8478761","Cu(In,Ga)Se  $_{2}$   (CIGS);quantum efficiency;recombination;solar cells","Temperature dependence;Photovoltaic cells;Photonic band gap;Wavelength measurement;Charge carrier processes;Radiative recombination","copper compounds;energy gap;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;indium compounds;semiconductor thin films;solar cells;ternary semiconductors;wide band gap semiconductors","CIGS solar cells;donor defects;SCAPS software;simulated spectra;acceptor cases;shallow defects;possible bulk defects;emission;basic handbook formulas;acceptor defects;recombination;temperature change;quasielectrical field;band gap grading;constant rate;one-stage process;absorber;CIGS layer;wavelength range;IQE spectra;temperature-dependent internal quantum efficiency;temperature dependence;electron volt energy 45.0 meV;electron volt energy 60.0 meV;temperature 100.0 K to 300.0 K;CIGS","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Power electronics engineers are often in favour of multiresonant controllers whereas motion control designers more often incorporate iterative learning controllers (ILC) into their systems. Both camps of researchers seem to be entrenched and rarely willing to admit that both techniques are capable of introducing exactly the same generating polynomial to the system. Moreover, both techniques in their basic forms suffer from a lack of robustness to a persevering non-zero control error, e.g. due to the physical limitations on the plant side. To render the techniques practical, several tweaks have to be made. Neither of them is also innately immune to the reference and/or disturbance signal frequency fluctuations. Even small frequency variations at the level of 1% can render the basic ILC impractical in the case of the grid-tied converter discussed in this paper. The paper is supposed to serve as the second chapter of the conversational guide on the similarity and challenges of multiresonant and iterative learning controllers. Alongside sparking the discussion, our main contribution here is a novel conditional learning concept within the ILC, inspired by the variable damping proposed for multiresonant controllers. An improvement gained by augmenting the basic ILC with the conditional learning is illustrated based on numerical simulations. Further possibilities of introducing an adaptation algorithm into the modified controller are suggested.","","978-9-0758-1528-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515548","repetitive process control;multiresonant control;iterative learning control;repetitive disturbance rejection;grid-tie converter;frequency fluctuations;adaptive fractional delay filter;adaptive resonant term;conditional learning","Frequency control;Frequency conversion;Resonant frequency;Transient analysis;Robustness;Europe","adaptive control;control system synthesis;damping;electric current control;iterative learning control;iterative methods;learning systems;motion control;power convertors;power grids;robust control","iterative learning current controllers;repetitive process control engineers;multiresonant controllers;power electronics engineers;motion control designers;persevering nonzero control error;grid-tied converter;modified controller;iterative learning controllers;conditional learning concept","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such devices require extremely stable phase and time synchronization by means of high frequency signals distributed along the accelerator facility. Coaxial cables are frequently used to distribute the reference signal over the large machine to synchronize electronic systems. These cables are the main source of undesirable phase drifts in the synchronization system. Signal phase drifts in cables are mainly caused by temperature and humidity variations and their values usually exceed required phase synchronization accuracy by more than an order of magnitude. Air pressure can also influence on the signal phase drifts but with a much smaller impact than from temperature and humidity changes. There are several approaches to reduce signal phase drifts in coaxial cables. This paper describes the realization of an active phase stabilization system based on the interference phenomenon. A phase-locked signal from the transmitter is reflected at the end of a coaxial cable link. Directional couplers placed along the cable pick up the forward and reflected signals and interfere them to cancel out the cable phase drifts. Distributed hardware including interferometer controller/transmitter and receiver modules were built to demonstrate the system concept and performance. FPGA I/O boards with an Ethernet interface are used to control the system operation. Specialized firmware and software were developed to calibrate and control the system. This paper describes the concept of the interferometer link, the designed hardware, basic control algorithms and performance evaluation results. A prototype of the link was built to distribute a 1.3 GHz signal through a coaxial cable. Measured values of the phase drift suppression factor exceeded the level of 100.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2020.2966018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8960277","Phase drift;phase-lock loop;synchronization system","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The measurement equipment onboard the rocket is prone to damage and failures due to the extreme operating conditions (such as great acceleration). Moreover, if the data is not sent to the ground station during the flight, but stored onboard, the rocket has to be located after landing to download the data. This is not always possible, as the rocket's landing position may be difficult to estimate. For these reasons, additional sensor for measuring rocket trajectory is desirable.

In each layer, the appropriate network elements have their own isolation level. The lowest layer of the Graph-based model represents virtual network elements with isolation traits used for calculating their isolation level. Climbing to the top of the stack of layers one can calculate, successively, isolation level for a network's physical element, a link, subnetworks and, the End-to-End slice's isolation level.

The MZI structure contains two single-mode fibers (SMFs), two coreless fiber (CLF) sections and an SHF section, which are spliced together in the order of SMF-CLF-SHF-CLF-SMF. The SMFs and the CLFs enable light lead in/out and beam splitting/combining, respectively. As a special feature of the structure, one hole of SHF is exposed for liquid filling and to form two MZIs as well. Three types of sensors are fabricated, namely S1, S2 and S3. Numerical simulation and experimental studies have been conducted to characterize the sensing performance. The RI sensitivity of the S1 using the ~550 μm long SHF section reaches 14,000 nm/RIU. When a shorter SHF section is used in S2, the detectable RI range is broadened due to larger FSR. When the closed hole of SHF in S3 is filled with liquid to introduce the Vernier effect, the sensitivity can be further enhanced to over 44,000 nm/RIU (i.e., Refractive Index Unit), which corresponds to the detection limit at the level of 1.0 × 10-5 RIU. This sensor design is original and easy to package, which gives it potential for label-free biochemical analyses.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2948087","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Centre (NCN) of Poland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8873618","Optical fiber sensor;refractive index sensing;side-hole fiber;Mach-Zehnder interferometer;Vernier effect.","Optical fiber sensors;Silicon compounds;Refractive index;Mach-Zehnder interferometers","fibre optic sensors;Mach-Zehnder interferometers;optical fibre fabrication;refractive index;refractive index measurement","Vernier effect;numerical simulation;beam splitting-combining;SHF section;sensor design;refractive index unit;detectable RI range;RI sensitivity;sensing performance;liquid filling;SMF-CLF-SHF-CLF-SMF;coreless fiber sections;single-mode fibers;MZI structure;side-hole fiber;dual Mach-Zehnder interferometer structure;refractive index sensor;high-sensitivity refractive index sensing","","","26","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, during measurements at changing environmental conditions, the surface of the fiber made of fused silica is subjected to stresses that can cause alterations in its structure. The problem is particularly important when long-term or biosensing measurements are considered and when sensor surface may be exposed to subsequent drying and immersion in aqueous solutions. The aim of this paper was to investigate the influence of sequential drying in air and soaking in water of the fused silica fiber cladding surface on the optical response of LPGs. We demonstrated that transmission spectrum of LPG measured in water before and after drying in air differed significantly and further changed with subsequent drying steps indicating increase of the local RI. All these changes correspond to the alterations in the cladding surface, i.e., its fracturing and pores rearrangement, caused by the stress induced during drying and then immersing in water, as well as possible corrosion and formation of nanosized objects on the cladding surface. The effect can be additionally influenced by washing the samples in organic solvents. We confirmed that measurements done in a flow-cell system, where the sensor was kept wet during the sensing experiment may eliminate the water-induced fiber surface alteration effect and thus minimize the amount of false results. Described findings are highly important for biosensing applications of any optical-fiber-based devices.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2019.2909947","Poland by the National Science Centre; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada; Canada Industrial Research Chairs Program; City of Gdynia, Poland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8684872","Long-period grating (LPG);material characterization;optical fiber sensor;refractive index (RI) sensing;water sorption","Optical surface waves;Optical sensors;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical refraction;Sensitivity;Temperature measurement;Surface cracks","diffraction gratings;drying;fibre optic sensors;optical fibre cladding;optical fibre fabrication;optical glass;refractive index;silicon compounds","local refractive index;water-induced fused silica glass surface alterations;fused silica fiber cladding surface;environmental conditions;label-free biosensing;exceptional refractive index sensitivity;long-period fiber gratings;optical-fiber-based devices;biosensing applications;subsequent drying steps;optical response;aqueous solutions;sensor surface;SiO2","","","30","Traditional","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This implies the need for convenient solutions to simplify screening and diagnosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of a novel wireless system in detecting breathing and snoring episodes during sleep. Methods: A wireless acoustic sensor was elaborated and implemented. Segmentation (based on spectral thresholding and heuristics) and classification of all breathing episodes during recording were implemented through a mobile application. The system was evaluated on 1520 manually labeled episodes registered from 40 real-world, whole-night recordings of 16 generally healthy subjects. Results: The differentiation between normal breathing and snoring had 88.8% accuracy. As the system is intended for screening, high specificity of 95% is reported.

Since ECoG recordings cannot be completely visually reviewed in a reasonable amount of time, computer algorithms for the automatic detection of seizures and spikes were developed. We proposed the spike detection algorithm based on the definition of the physical properties of the sought spikes (duration and amplitude). The parameters are easily interpreted by neurophysiologists. The detection sensitivity was 93%, and the precision was 99%. In addition, based on the number of spikes detected on individual electrodes, it is possible to draw the “frequency of spike occurrence” map.

The goal of the challenge is to assess the performance of existing ear recognition techniques on a challenging large-scale ear dataset and to analyze performance of the technology from various viewpoints, such as generalization abilities to unseen data characteristics, sensitivity to rotations, occlusions and image resolution and performance bias on sub-groups of subjects, selected based on demographic criteria, i.e. gender and ethnicity. Research groups from 12 institutions entered the competition and submitted a total of 13 recognition approaches ranging from descriptor-based methods to deep-learning models. The majority of submissions focused on ensemble based methods combining either representations from multiple deep models or hand-crafted with learned image descriptors. Our analysis shows that methods incorporating deep learning models clearly outperform techniques relying solely on hand-crafted descriptors, even though both groups of techniques exhibit similar behavior when it comes to robustness to various covariates, such presence of occlusions, changes in (head) pose, or variability in image resolution. The results of the challenge also show that there has been considerable progress since the first UERC in 2017, but that there is still ample room for further research in this area.","2376-4201","978-1-7281-3640-0","10.1109/ICB45273.2019.8987337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8987337","","","ear;image recognition;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence)","ensemble based methods;image descriptors;deep learning models;image resolution;2019 Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge;person recognition;ear images;ear recognition techniques;large-scale ear dataset;descriptor-based methods;deep-learning models","","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the simultaneous message passing model, A and B send certain information to a Referee, who makes the decision. The overall goal is to minimize the amount of communication involved while not exceeding desired error probability. This is achieved by sending only fingerprints of the original n-bit strings. In the best classical protocols, these scale as O(√n) if A and B have no access to shared randomness [1]. The recently proposed [2] and demonstrated quantum fingerprinting [3], exploiting phase-modulated weak coherent pulses, provides O(log2 n) scaling in the number of used qubits, but needs phase stability between A and B. Here we introduce and analyse a quantum fingerprinting protocol based on two-photon interference which does require a shared phase reference and works in scenarios when the global phase of transmitted signals becomes completely random. Interestingly, the performance of this protocol, quantified in terms of the Chernoff information [4], is enhanced through the use of non-classical single-photon states, even in the regime of high transmission loss.","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8087401","","Error probability;Protocols;Interference;Photonics;Standards;Hamming distance;Physics","communication complexity;error statistics;message passing;phase modulation;protocols;quantum communication","error probability;communication complexity problems;message passing model;photon interference;Chernoff information;quantum fingerprinting protocol;phase-modulated weak coherent pulses","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The shape of the farmland surface can significantly affect the satellite radar cross-section e.g. rows usually formed in parallel ridges separated from each other by some distance. To investigate how the shape of the cultivation surface affects the RF-signal reflections, simulations were carried out.

Therefore, this article considers the input parallel output parallel (IPOP) connection of two dual active bridge (DAB) modules as a representative modular converter, and to answer a question of: how to improve (maximize) efficiency of such a system, at different power demands and varying ESS voltage, only by a turn on/off operation of the module without any circuit and control algorithm changes. The proposed solution defines an operating area (enclosing different ES's voltage levels and loading power conditions) showing where one or two modules should operate to improve the overall efficiency. A curve fitting approach and polynomial approximation of the single module's input/output power curves are utilized for the proposed algorithm based on parametric functions. After simulation study, the method is validated with two 1.4 kW SiC-based DAB converters, operating at 100 kHz of switching frequency within a wide (0-270 V) ES's voltage range.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2019.2951833","Foundation for Polish Science co-financed; European Commission; European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8892643","Dual active bridge (DAB);energy storage;parallel operation IPOP;optimization","Topology;Energy storage;Optimization;Bridge circuits;Power demand;Energy exchange;Power generation","bridge circuits;curve fitting;DC-DC power convertors;energy consumption;energy storage;optimisation;polynomial approximation;silicon compounds;switching convertors;voltage-source convertors","switching frequency;polynomial approximation;curve fitting approach;ESS voltage;SiC-based DAB converters;IPOP;energy storage voltage levels;dc-dc converters;dc-type energy storage systems;modular converter;input parallel output parallel connection;bidirectional energy transfer;energy efficiency optimization;dual active bridge converters;voltage 0.0 V to 270.0 V;frequency 100.0 kHz;SiC","","","36","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similarly to radio-based data broadcasting systems, such as Wi-Fi, VLC opens the possibilities of hiding information in the public channel. In this paper, we describe (for the first time, to the best of our knowledge) the implementation of steganographic data transmission in a VLC system called LuxSteg. This VLC system utilizes pulse position modulation and direct sequence-code division multiple access modulation. In our implementation, multiple steganographic data streams are mixed with the spreading codes and combined with the overt data stream. We achieve a steganographic transmission rate of approximately 1 Mb/s hidden in a 110-Mb/s data stream.

Modern optical gyroscope systems, which are a critical part of inertial measurement units (IMU) of contemporary airplanes, drones, spacecrafts and others, are definitely one of the most impressive examples of successful implementation of photonic sensors. Typically, the angular velocity is measured by utilizing the Sagnac effect occurring in rotating optical medium, which can be either an optical fiber loop or a ring laser.

It shows how the two most important systems in the human body act to function efficiently. The effect that is believed to show these dependencies is Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), which causes accelerations of heart rate during inspiration and decelerates the rhythm during passive act of expiration. There are many methods to analyse the occurrence of RSA, from the basic peak-to-valley method, to more complicated ones as e.g. spectral coherence. But all of them have flaws like omitting samples or giving only a single value for the entire analysed period. In this paper, we present a simple, numeric method, which enables the analysis of the changes in the strength of RSA over the time. Our solution is called Cardiorespiratory Coupling Assessment (CCA) and calculates the value of RSA in consecutive, one-minute long windows as the median of the differences of RR intervals detected during expiration and inspiration in each window. The data necessary for the CCA method to work properly includes ECG and the respiratory signal from the chest belt measured simultaneously. In our research, we first analysed the performance of the method on synthetically generated data to verify its performance. Than we compared short 5 minute recordings obtained during spontaneous and controlled breathing and then analysed 4 hours long signals extracted from nighttime recordings. The results show that the CCA method allows to measure accurately the changes in strength of RSA over the time in both short and long signals. Moreover, the results indicate that the level of the RSA strength is larger in recordings from spontaneous breathing phase than from the controlled breathing.","2325-887X","978-1-5386-6630-2","10.22489/CinC.2017.154-409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331564","","Electrocardiography;Couplings;Belts;Cardiology;Time-domain analysis;Physics;Autonomic nervous system","cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics","controlled breathing;CCA method;short signals;RSA strength;universal method;arrhythmia;human body act;heart rate;inspiration;peak-to-valley method;complicated ones;single value;entire analysed period;simple method;numeric method;one-minute long windows;respiratory signal;autonomic nervous system;cardiorespiratory coupling assessment;ECG;time 5.0 min;time 4.0 hour","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their important goal is to ensure three-phase symmetrical and pure sinusoidal grid current waveforms. Unfortunately, frequent adverse of grid voltage conditions like the occurrence of higher order harmonics and dips/sags leads to problems in maintaining high-quality parameters of current and stable operation of PEC. Therefore, a more complex control algorithms are usually used to solve those problems. In this paper, effective and simple control is proposed to mitigate grid current distortions caused by grid-voltage harmonics. This improvement of current quality can be easily obtained in control of grid-connected PEC using only band notch filtered grid voltage as a feedforward without any additional control loops parallel connected to linear current controllers (tuned to fundamental frequency).

Currently, the integral and frequency methods are mostly used to define reactive power and do not give high accuracy in the calculations of power balance or cannot describe the essence of physical processes. The problem is complicated in DC electric transport systems due to random impulse character of voltages and currents. As a comparison, the calculation of reactive power according to various approaches was performed for the DE1 electric locomotive. It is suggested that the instantaneous reactive power should be used for the analysis of electromagnetic exchange processes in DC power systems. The paper shows the definition and main formulas for defining the instantaneous reactive power taking into consideration the random character of voltage and current. Numerical calculations together with statistical analysis were performed for two variants of experimentally recorded voltages and currents: the first one - on the bus-bar of traction substation, which supplies the section with the Pendolino trains in Poland and the second one - on the current collector of the VL8 electric locomotive in Ukraine.

However, lowering of passive components' parameters brings issues with double frequency voltage fluctuation on the capacitors of quasi-impedance network.

However, such an analysis is usually performed for steady-state modes and only under the condition that the time realization of voltages and currents, being deterministic for continuous quantities, have infinite length. De facto, the electric transport devices operate in non-stationary dynamic modes (starting up, coasting, acceleration, regenerative braking, stopping, wheel spin, voltage surges, etc.). As a result, the voltage across the traction motors and the current flowing through them are noncontinuous pulsed stochastic processes. It is necessary to add that in emergency modes the voltage and current are short-term single pulses. The paper presents the spectral analysis of such random sequences of pulses as well as their fronts and decays, the concepts of actual and instantaneous spectra. The analytical expressions for amplitudes and the initial phases of k-th harmonics are obtained using the discrete Fourier transformation. The numerical calculations of the spectral composition of stochastic pulse processes of voltage and current were performed for the DE1 and VL8 electric locomotives (Ukraine) as well as for trams operating on the routes of the city of Dnipro. The actual and instantaneous spectra, as well as the spectra of the full correlation functions and their “tails”, were determined for the electric traction voltages and currents.","","978-1-7281-2160-4","10.1109/ESS.2019.8764205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764205","spectrum;electric transport;voltage;pulse;current;stochastic;instantaneous;correlation function","Random processes;Harmonic analysis;Surges;Conferences;Estimation;Electromagnetic compatibility;Substations","discrete Fourier transforms;electric locomotives;electromagnetic compatibility;spectral analysis;stochastic processes;traction motors","nonstationary pulse stochastic electromagnetic processes;electromagnetic compatibility level;steady-state modes;nonstationary dynamic modes;traction motors;noncontinuous pulsed stochastic processes;emergency modes;short-term single pulses;instantaneous spectra;VL8 electric locomotives;electric traction voltages;power consumption quality;electric transport system devices;k-th harmonics initial phase;discrete fourier transformation;Dnipro;electric traction currents;spectral theory analysis;numerical calculations;stochastic pulse processes spectral composition;DE1 electric locomotives","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most oppressive aspects of the research in this field are technical requirements for sensors. They have to be extremely sensitive, as well as possess an extremely wide dynamic range of operation from 0.01 to 100 Hz. This paper points out that solutions basing on the optical technology are the most promising devices in comparison to existing mechanical and electromechanical ones. Especially, instruments basing on the von Laue-Sagnac effect seem to be the most appropriate to investigate rotational phenomena due to the fact that they are entirely insensitive to a translational motion, operate without inertia mass, and are able to measure rotation rate in wide frequency and amplitude band. The paper presents a new device named FOSREM that, based on the FOG minimum configuration, possesses special solutions that makes it perfect, in our knowledge, for any rotation sensing. It enables to measure only a rotational component in a wide range of signal amplitude of 2·10-8-10 rad/s, as well as in a wide frequency band from DC to 328.12 Hz. The presented performance characteristics, as well as a laboratory investigation, confirm FOSREM's opportunity to measure rotation both in seismological observatories and engineering constructions.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2017.2769136","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; Statutory Activity of Military University of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094241","Optical fiber sensor;rotational seismology;Sagnac effect;sensor","Rotation measurement;Seismology;Optical fibers;Optical sensors;Frequency measurement;Seismic measurements","fibre optic gyroscopes;Sagnac interferometers;seismology;seismometers","FOG minimum configuration;rotational seismology;rotational movements;engineering structures;optical technology;von Laue-Sagnac effect;rotational phenomena;rotation rate;rotation sensing;rotational component;seismological observatories;engineering constructions;fiber-optic Sagnac interferometer;earthquakes;mines;translational motion;FOSREM;frequency 328.12 Hz;frequency 0.01 Hz to 100.0 Hz","","1","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three classes are recognized: red, yellow and green, which correspond with 3 stages of drill state. Red class indicates the drill, which is worn out and should be replaced immediately in drilling process. Yellow class corresponds to the state in which warning should be sent to the operator to check manually state of the drill. The last class corresponds to the green state indicating good condition of drill, enabling further use in production. The important advantage of transfer learning approach is possibility of training classification model using only small portion of data. This is in contrast to the classical deep learning methods of convolutional neural networks, which require very large data base to achieve acceptable accuracy of class recognition. The results of numerical experiments in drill state recognition have confirmed suitability of this novel method to accurate class recognition at small population of available learning data.","","978-1-5386-1040-4","10.1109/CPEE.2017.8093087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093087","deep learning;convolutional neural networks;tool condition monitoring","Support vector machines;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Convolution;Neural networks;Production","condition monitoring;drilling;drilling machines;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mechanical engineering computing;production engineering computing;wear","convolutional neural network;drill state recognition;accurate class recognition;drill wear;drilling process;transfer learning approach;classical deep learning methods;learning data;CNN;hole images;laminated chipboard;training classification model;tool condition monitoring","","1","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commonly used screen printed circuits, despite their low cost, have simply too wide paths (typical line width is about 100 μm) and require flat substrate.

The possibility to print 3D structures with the line about 0,5 μm thick and 10 μm wide make it even comparable to the expensive, many-staged photolithography. Nevertheless still some important steps are missing to print completely unified microscale circuit with aerosol jet printing technique. One is microvia formation, which is the primary condition to obtain highly dense circuit. The other is external electrical elements assemblage to increase the functionality and application ability. The fulfilment of both gaps will allow to print microscale flexible circuits. Our work presents the essential research of microvia and pad formation made with aerosol jet printing technique. We have tested various pad shapes and sizes suitable for industrial smd elements for lead-free soldering and grade them in the terms of connection strength and resistance.

This paper is to provide a co-design methodology that can cope with all these problems and ensure satisfactory control effect for the speed synchronization control of IMT powertrain systems. First, a networked IMT powertrain system using CAN as underlying network is presented and the dynamic model for the speed synchronization control is derived. Second, the network-induced delay model is introduced and improved considering data packet capability and utilization ratio limitation. The control-orient discrete-time model is also derived based on the improved delay model. Third, a co-design methodology using sliding mode controller and offline priority scheduling based on Lyapunov stability criterion is proposed.

In this study, we focused on laminar, U-shaped accelerations of heart rate - approximately 20-40 seconds long - in the nighttime recordings. Methods: The influence of U-shape accelerations on HRV parameters was evaluated based on night-time 34 RR interval time series obtained from healthy adults. We performed calculations on recordings without top 5% intervals (in terms of RR duration), without bottom 5% intervals and on recordings with randomly shuffled RR intervals. For each recording, the VLF frequency band, Shannon and Sample Entropy, standard deviation, mean, RMSSD, Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA), and symbolic analysis parameters were calculated using signals with and without modifications. Results: U-shape accelerations accounted for 5.3±3.3% of the total recordings duration. There were significant differences between the signals without modification and without the smallest 5% intervals (thus without majority of U-shape periods) of the values of HF, LF and VLF frequency bands power, Shannon and Sample Entropy, standard deviation and symbolic analysis parameters (p<;0.05). We also observed a significant reduction of multifractality using Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA) after removing the U-shape accelerations from the recording. These effects did not occur in the surrogate data with shuffled samples (p<;0.05 was obtained only for symbolic analysis parameters), and in case of the signals with rejected the largest 5% of intervals (p<;0.05 only for symbolic analysis parameters and Shannon entropy). Conclusions: Characteristic U-shape accelerations in nighttime RR time series, despite a short total duration, have a significant influence on the VLF frequency band, multifractality and the complexity of the signal. The nature of these events is not clear and requires further study.","2325-887X","978-1-5386-6630-2","10.22489/CinC.2017.279-341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331679","","Acceleration;Heart rate variability;Entropy;Fractals;Standards;Cardiology","bioelectric potentials;electrocardiography;entropy;fractals;medical signal processing;time series","VLF frequency band;U-shaped accelerations;night-time 34 RR interval time series;symbolic analysis parameters;U-shape periods;sample entropy;heart rate variability fluctuations;multiscale multifractal analysis;U-shape accelerations;heart rate multifractality;HRV fluctuations;Shannon entropy","","2","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are practical for such devices because of the emergence of robust and reasonably priced femtosecond lasers operating in this part of spectrum. This further enabled pulse preserving and coherent, so called all-normal dispersion supercontinuum (ANDi SC), covering over a full octave of around 600-1600 nm with pulse duration post-compressed down to single optical cycles. When using the new erbium (1560 nm) or thulium (around 2000 nm) femtosecond lasers as pump sources, exceeding the 2400 nm barrier has proved a challenge. ANDi SC requires strong nonlinear response of the optical material, since self-phase modulation (SPM) and optical wave breaking (OWB) mediated four-wave mixing (FWM) are almost exclusively shaping the ANDi SC pulses. Flatness of the normal dispersion profile is also important, because FWM in this case is not phase-matched and takes place at the instance of the temporal overlap of the OWB components. Here we investigate and explain the bandwidth limitation of NIR pulse-preserving coherent SC by confronting ANDi SC generation performance in two types of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs). One type (NC21 series) has a flat NIR dispersion profile at the cost of nonlinearity, due to low nonlinear refractive index n2 the glasses forming the PCF lattice. The other type (NC38 series) features weaker dependence of the effective mode area Aeff on wavelength and much higher nonlinearity, albeit at the cost of flatness of the engineered normal dispersion profile.","","978-1-5090-6736-7","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2017.8087515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8087515","","Nonlinear optics;Glass;Photonic crystal fibers;Ultrafast optics;Laser excitation;Optical fiber dispersion","holey fibres;multiwave mixing;optical fibre dispersion;optical pulse compression;optical pulse generation;optical pumping;photonic crystals;refractive index;self-phase modulation;supercontinuum generation","all-normal dispersion supercontinuum;nonlinearity;coherent supercontinuum generation bandwidth;photonic crystal fibers;spectrally broadband light;coherent light;frequency metrology;ultrashort pulse generation;femtosecond lasers;ANDi SC;pulse duration;compressed pulses;optical material;self-phase modulation;SPM;optical wave breaking;OWB;four-wave mixing;FWM;normal dispersion profile flatness;NIR pulse-preserving coherent SC;nonlinear refractive index;effective mode area;wavelength 2 mum","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the verification process, the DUT must be de-embedded, i.e. the contribution of adapters must be extracted from the measured S-parameters. The Thru-Reflect-Line TRL calibration of the VNA is a suitable tool for that task, provided the necessary hardware and software facilities of the VNAs are available. If not, alternatives are required. The Authors presented such an alternative calibration method in their previous publications. Frequency limitations of the de-embedding process were reported in them.

The main attention is paid to the issue of considering all the necessary implementation and deployment details, which is often underestimated and perceived as an easy and straightforward task, especially in comparison with the process of development of theoretical approach.

Moreover, the described solution is still highly parallelizable such as the classical BP algorithm. The solution can be adapted to a real-time SAR system with modern high-end computational units such as graphical processor units (GPUs) that support parallel computing. In this paper, the BP algorithm is clearly described with its barycentric-based modification. The proposed method is compared with a classical BP algorithm based on the measurement of simulated and real data.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2932200","Polish National Center for Research and Development (NCBiR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782653","SAR;back projection;barycentric coordinates;radar imaging;SAR processing","Radar imaging;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Image resolution;Image reconstruction;Sensors","backpropagation;image processing;neural nets;radar computing;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","fast barycentric-based;SAR imaging;projection algorithm;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar technique;reverse virtual synthetic aperture beam;observed radar scene;raw radar data;complete imaging processing;classical well-known BP algorithm;computationally demanding methods;barycentric-based BP method;calculated beam;classical BP algorithm;real-time SAR system;high-end computational units;support parallel computing","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the capacity gain comes with a cost. In particular, multiple analog radio frequency (RF) chains are required at both the transmitter and the receiver, thereby leading to a higher implementation cost, more power consumption, and lower energy efficiency. This paper presents a receiver with only one RF chain for 2 × 2 MIMO transmission system. Proposed design is based on a time modulated antenna array (TMAA) with beam-steering functionality and a wideband software defined radio (SDR). Spatial streams were created by demultiplexing spectral components (sidebands) generated by periodical ON/OFF switching. Number of RF chains was reduced from 2 to 1 while maintaining sufficiently low correlation of spatial streams, which is required to perform MIMO transmission.

Structure of a proposed impedance network is designed to limit the voltage of the capacitors by a factor of two and, in consequence, voltage stress of the input diode is also lower. The modified current-fed quasi Z-source converter connected to the standard grid (3 ×400V RMS) is able to operate with SiC Schottky diodes rated at 1200 V.

Therefore it was difficult to establish in GUM directly TWSTFT station. Based on many years of close cooperation between National Institute of Telecommunications (NIT) and GUM the decision of placing TWSTFT station at NIT has been made, because NIT is located outside of strict city center and the antenna view is much better. The optical time transfer system (OTTS) to connect GUM and NIT is used. The length of the fiber optic line is about 28 km. Until now, the line was used for the purpose of continuous time comparison between the two organizations, so the entire fiber optic part of time transfer had to be redesigned to support two parallel transmissions.

It provides the advanced control algorithms to improve the voltage and current quality in LV microgrid and MV distribution grid. It can also be responsible for the proper power management in interconnected AC as well as DC microgrids. Taking into consideration the DC microgrid the power balance and DC voltage level is normally provided by hybrid energy storage system. However the battery capacity is limited and then the additional processes have to be conducted to keep the power balance. The advanced power management algorithm has to considered the communication infrastructure in the microgrid but it also should provide proper power sharing when the communication is corrupted. From the other hand, the power electronics converters connected to the DC microgrid (a smart transformer DC link sub-circuits, RESs or constant power loads) should work with a nominal DC voltage level. Therefore, it should be kept by the control system as long as possible. Using the smart transformer as a control system for the microgrid the energy can be provided in many ways (from MV grid, by AC load reduction or by lower DC voltage in critical situation). Thus, a novel power management algorithm implemented in smart transformer control has been developed and presented. It includes five processes with decision flowcharts based on the battery state of charge. The simulation research has been conducted and briefly described in this paper, proving the proper operation of developed solution.","2163-5145","978-1-7281-3666-0","10.1109/ISIE.2019.8781497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8781497","smart transformer;DC microgrid;power management","Microgrids;Batteries;Power system management;Voltage measurement;State of charge;Voltage control","distributed power generation;electric current control;energy management systems;energy storage;power convertors;power distribution control;power electronics;power generation control;power grids;power transformers;voltage control","advanced control algorithms;current quality;power balance;power electronics converters;smart transformer DC link sub-circuits;nominal DC voltage level;control system;smart transformer control;voltage parameters;power management algorithm;power sharing;DC microgrid subsystem;voltage quality;LV microgrid;MV distribution grid;communication infrastructure;RESs","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The control strategy is a state-dependent piecewise constant-order optimization problem, that divides the variation of the state variable into arbitrary intervals and selects different fractional PI orders obtained via constrained numerical minimization in order to best suit the dynamics of the process. Various definitions of order switching, i.e. A-,B-,D- and E -type are investigated. Numerical experiments on identified model of the water tank system are conducted. Results obtained during numerical experiments are then implemented on real physical object - CE105MV Coupled Tanks system. Authors compare obtained results both from numerical and experimental tests with other popular control strategies in respect of outcome but also critical view on complexity of implementation.","","978-1-7281-0702-8","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2019.8765922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765922","variable order;PI controller;fractional calculus;water tank","PI control;Switches;Minimization;Storage tanks;Numerical models;Fractional calculus","Bode diagrams;control system synthesis;level control;minimisation;nonlinear control systems;optimisation;PI control;tanks (containers)","nonlinear water tank system;variable-order fractional PI controller;state-dependent piecewise constant-order optimization problem;state variable;arbitrary intervals;constrained numerical minimization;state-dependent fractional-order PI control strategy;order switching;CE105MV Coupled Tanks system;CE105MV Coupled Tanks system","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has four subtypes: Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2-enriched (HER2-E) and Basal-like (BL). For the cause of breast cancer subtypes, there are different genetic and epigenetic factors involved in its progression and susceptibility. Thus, the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic biomarkers can be helpful to understand the biological mechanisms better and to improve the diagnostic processes of this disease and its subtypes. Hence, this fact motivated us to investigate the epigenetic factor, such as DNA Methylation, with the integration of gene expression in order to find epigenetic biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes. In this regard, we have identified set of up and down regulated genes for each subtype using differential analysis. Thereafter, regression based feature ranking problem is formed in order to find the DNA Methylation site that is mostly responsible for the change in expression of a gene, which is considered as an epigenetic biomarker. A bagging integrated ensemble of decision trees is used for the same. The results of top ten up and down regulated genes and their corresponding most significant DNA Methylation sites are reported for breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, these genes are validated visually by means of survival and expression plots, showing TF-Gene-DNA Methylation interactions, Protein-Protein interaction network, KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. The results show that top differentially expressed up and down regulated genes viz. MMP11, NUF2, EXO1, HJURP, HOXA4, SYNM, CAV1 and COL4A3BP in breast cancer subtypes may change their expression because of DNA Methylation sites viz. cg22418565, cg26029744, cg24741598, cg04550103, cg25952581, cg02109162, cg18498156 and cg04985097 respectively.

The sensor is fabricated by femtosecond laser in a single-mode fiber. A cylindrical cavity is micromachined in the fiber cladding and partly in the fiber core, forming an interferometric structure. We have found that when the spectral response of the structure to RI is considered, a periodic pattern is observed and the sensitivity highly increases with RI and reaches over 23 000 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.4200-1.4400 RIU. Moreover, during the measurement of cavities with diameters in the order of tens of micrometers, we found the cavity-filling process to be both difficult and time-consuming, especially when high-RI liquids are being investigated. We therefore applied reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, which significantly changed the wettability of the cavity's surface and enabled fast cavity filling with any investigated liquid.

However, for data transmission over a longer distance, dispersion in multi-mode fiber limits the performance. To achieve high data rates at a distance above 1 km VCSELs with narrow optical spectrum can be used. Oxide-confined VCSELs can be engineered in a way to increase leakage of the high order transverse optical modes thus promoting single-mode operation. Such leaky single-mode VCSELs experience smaller dispersion and hence allow transmission over longer distances. Important feature of the leaky design is the leakage of high order modes through the second cavity of the VCSEL. This effect can be used for lateral integration to photo-diodes or waveguides. In this paper, we demonstrate high speed transmission at 25 Gbit/s up to 1 km of OM4 multimode fiber using 850 nm leaky VCSELs.

They are designed to be used in power electronic converters, such as grid-tie converters or constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) true sine wave inverters, as well as in motion control systems, especially in assembly line robots. The proposed control algorithms combine the good responsiveness of the classic deterministic iterative learning controller (ILC) with the robustness offered by the evolutionary population-based swarm controller. Properties of the control algorithms are illustrated in the CACF inverter using computer simulations. One out of the schemes is then employed in the three-phase grid-tie converter to facilitate sinusoidal currents under the distorted grid voltage conditions. A weakness not manifested in the case of the CACF inverter, however clearly apparent in the case of the grid-tie converter if envisaged to interface a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), is identified. The concept of an adaptive evaporation rate for the PSRC is then investigated to enhance the performance of the original hybrid repetitive controller. This is to facilitate the controller's future deployment in the power electronic interface for an SMES system where learning should last at most a few seconds instead of tens of seconds.","","978-90-75815-27-6","10.23919/EPE17ECCEEurope.2017.8098960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8098960","Active front-end;converter control;optimal control;repetitive process control;iterative learning control;adynamic optimization problem;repetitive disturbance rejection;particle swarm optimization;hybrid part-stochastic part-deterministic iterative learning control","Particle swarm optimization;Robustness;Control systems;Europe;Optimization;Inverters","industrial robots;invertors;iterative learning control;motion control;particle swarm optimisation;power convertors;power grids;robotic assembly;superconducting magnet energy storage","hybridization schemes;repetitive systems;PSRC;power electronic converters;constant-frequency true sine wave inverters;motion control systems;assembly line robots;control algorithms;CACF inverter;three-phase grid-tie converter;distorted grid voltage conditions;particle swarm iterative learning controllers;superconducting magnetic energy storage;hybrid repetitive controller;SMES system;power electronic interface","","1","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes simple strategy, which provide good performance of Voltage Oriented Control current control technique under strongly distorted grid voltage with robust grid voltage synchronization scheme.

We identify a noise parameter whose order of magnitude separates near-noiseless quantum fingerprinting, with signal duration effectively independent of  $n$ , from a regime where the impact of AWGN is significant. In the latter case the signal duration is found to scale as  $O(\sqrt {n})$ , analogously to classical fingerprinting.

The genesis and structure of crime, its intensity, and dynamics are subjects of intense scientific studies carried out by researchers in various fields of science. Increasing possibilities to track crime events give public organizations and police departments the opportunity to collect and store detailed data, including spatial and temporal information. At the same time, the crowd-sourced open datasets as social media and Internet datasets can be a valuable source of knowledge about various behavior patterns and social phenomena, including those of criminal nature. Thus, exploratory analysis and data mining become an important part of the current methodology for the detection and forecasting of crime development. The ability to use data analysis tools to extract useful information related to criminal events enables law enforcement agencies to more efficiently allocate their resources to specific crime areas. It allows the effective deployment of officers to high-risk crime areas and elimination from areas with a decreasing crime trend as well as developing effective crime prevention strategies. The purpose of this paper is to show the usefulness of analytic algorithms in predicting crimes, however, there are other applications of such analyzes in the area of law enforcement, such as defining criminal hot spots, creating criminal profiles, and detecting crime trends.

Allan variance analysis has indicated that they have proper parameters for the rotational seismology investigation (angle random walk equals 3.20 · 10-8 rad/√s, as well as bias instability equals 2.41 · 10-8 rad/s). Moreover, regarding applied special electronic processing, they provide rotation rate as an output instead of a change of an angle like in commercially available fiber optic gyroscopes.

If impedance cardiography (ICG) signal tracks changes of blood volume within segment of thorax, it can be used to estimate Pwk(t) noninvasively in humans. During late diastole, according to reservoir-wave model Pao(t)= Pwk(t). Moreover, Pwk(t) in aorta and pressure in peripheral arteries should be similar. If these assumptions hold true, during late diastole, shapes of Pao(t), of pressure in peripheral arteries, and of impedance cardiography signal should be exponential decay curves with the same time constant. Parameters of exponential decay curves of radial pressure obtained with Finapres and of cardiac impedance were compared in 4 subjects. Different locations of ICG sensing electrodes were tested We found that degree of similarity between ICG and Finapres signals depends on the location of ICG sensing electrodes. Motion artifacts and O wave distorted ICG curves and diminished the similarity between the two curves. Least effected and most similar to decaying portion of radial pressure curve was the impedance signal obtained with sensing electrodes localized upon the abdominal aorta, but the shape of two signals still considerably varied. Thus, we conclude that impedance signal can be used to determine the parameters of Pwk(t) curve in humans only if essential improvement in gaining and processing of this signal will be applied.","2325-887X","978-1-5386-6630-2","10.22489/CinC.2017.294-323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331692","","Impedance;Blood pressure;Blood;Electrodes;Shape;Cardiography;Motion artifacts","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;blood;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;haemodynamics;medical signal processing","blood volume;late diastole;peripheral arteries;exponential decay curves;ICG sensing electrodes;radial pressure curve;abdominal aorta;cardiac impedance signal;circulatory system;aortic blood pressure curve;pressure components;impedance cardiography signal tracking;reservoir-wave model","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The double stream gas-puff target was produced by injection of krypton and xenon (KrXe) gas mixture into a hollow stream of helium. Commercially available EKSPLA Nd:YAG 1.06 micron laser was used to irradiate the KrXe gas puff target with 3 nanosecond pulse duration having 0.8 J energy.

To investigate chemical modifications, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy was used. The wettability of the sample surfaces was examined by Water Contact Angle (W CA) measurements. EUV surface modification of PVF films resulted in formation of wall type rippled structures on the polymer surfaces. The surface roughness of the EUV treated surfaces was increased up to 287 nm and 21° reduction was observed in the WCA of the PVF films.

Nevertheless, the problems that designers face when approaching these systems-of-systems are still eclipsed by the heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-level complexity of those. In spite of the many underlying technological challenges, how to optimally architect distributed satellite systems, remains an open source of debate. In this context, this paper presents a design-oriented methodology that is aimed at providing high-level design solutions for this type of architectures in generic EO use-cases. In order to find optimal solutions, the methodology detailed in this paper is grounded on an aggregated architectural figure-of-merit that compresses: (a) system-level performance metrics; (b) use-case requirements; (c) development and launch costs; and (d) a set of architectural quality attributes. The latter contributing term models, assesses and weights several of the so-called “ilities” of an architecture and allows to select designs that exhibit some desired qualities. With a dimensionality of more than five thousand architectural alternatives, the study has been illustrated with a marine weather forecast use-case. Both the exploration of design alternatives and the analysis of the results have shown the benefits of medium and small satellite platforms and have stressed their potential in the design of distributed satellite systems. Finally, this paper concludes by suggesting that this very optimization framework and methodology could also be used for a quantitative gap analysis aiming at deriving the technological road map for future engineering teams.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396712","","Computer architecture;Instruments;Space vehicles;Satellites;Measurement;Optimization;Computational modeling","artificial satellites;geophysical equipment","satellite platforms;satellite architectures;high-level design solutions;system-level performance metrics;distributed satellite systems;optimized model-based design space exploration;multiorbit multiplatform Earth observation spacecraft;Earth observation services","","3","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The EM method was used to determine the ROIs, and the BIC criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. The selected values of the matrix of transitions were used for learning and testing of the classifier. Very rigorous testing of the proposed algorithm was carried out approaching the actual operating conditions of the expert system. The presented results indicate that for some images there is a chance of identifying experts in the field of visual arts using transitions as oculographic features.","","978-1-5386-1040-4","10.1109/CPEE.2017.8093045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093045","expert system;eyetracking;ROI;expected-maximization;classification;transitions","Art;Visualization;Expert systems;Testing;Clustering algorithms;Classification algorithms;Image recognition","electro-oculography;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;pattern clustering;psychology;statistical analysis","visual arts;oculography signals;sight transitions;characteristic image areas;ROI;automatic expert identification;region-of-interest;Department of Experimental Psychology;Catholic University of Lublin;EM method","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we present an alternative method, which utilizes a gradient effective permittivity model based on the classical Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula. In our model the nanoparticle layer is homogenized into several effective sublayers, whose permittivities depend on the spatial distribution of nanoparticles (and consequently volume fraction) in the direction normal to the substrate. The presented approach enables more accurate prediction of the properties of inhomogenous nanoparticle layers in a simpler way than by simulating actual particle distributions. The model is applied to simulate a plasmonic sensor covered by a Pd nanoparticle layer which undergoes sintering. The results of finite-difference-time-domain and transfer-matrix simulations with effective gradient layers are consistent with rigorous simulations and are more precise than analogous simulations with a single Maxwell-Garnett effective layer.","","978-1-5386-3768-5","10.1109/MetaMaterials.2017.8107840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8107840","","Nanoparticles;Permittivity;Sensors;Plasmons;Substrates;Dielectrics;Finite difference methods","finite difference time-domain analysis;Maxwell equations;nanoparticles;permittivity","permittivities;inhomogenous nanoparticle layers;plasmonic sensor;Pd nanoparticle layer;single Maxwell-Garnett effective layer;gradient effective medium model;average response;gradient effective permittivity model;classical Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula","","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The devices demonstrate single-mode continuous wave operation with the transverse side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) varying in the range of 40-45 dB up to roll-over currents. The increase in mirror losses due to the etching of the top DBR makes the output optical power increase to 6 mW and causes the wallplug efficiency value to reach 20%, but SMSR remains in the range of 40-45 dB. This also makes it possible to reduce both the photon lifetime and, as a result, the effect of damping and increase the modulation bandwidth to 9 GHz. The observed open and clear eye diagrams indicate that non-return-to-zero operation is possible at bit rates of up to 30 Gbps without equalization or forward error correction.

In our research, we decided to investigate electrochemical activity of fluorescein and determine its concentration with the use of differential pulse voltammetry and spectrofluorimetry in order to compare the utility of each method for fluorescein detection, towards simultaneous optical and electrochemical detection of bioanalytes. Due to the strong effect of pH of the environment on the analyte properties, we utilized buffer solutions of various pH during all experiments. Results of the voltammetric measurements indicated that fluorescein is electrochemically active compound, with the electrochemical activity affected by the pH of environment. Fluorescein undergoes irreversible one-step electrochemical oxidation in the potential range from 0 V to 1.4 V on graphene screen-printed electrodes. Differential pulse voltammetric method allowed to successfully detect fluorescein at micromolar concentration levels. Comparison of the data obtained by each measurement method allowed claiming, that electrochemical methods are more suitable for fluorescein determination in the solutions of low pH, whereas spectrofluorimetric method is more advantageous in the case of alkaline solutions. The further research should be performed in the context of the study on electrochemical activity of fluorescein conjugated with bioanalytes e.g. antibody.","","978-1-5386-4107-1","10.1109/COE.2018.8435165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8435165","electrochemical activity;fluorescein;voltammetry;graphene screen-printed electrodes;spectroscopic methods","Fluorescence;Electrodes;Absorption;Calibration;Electric potential;Graphene;Optical sensors","chemical variables measurement;dyes;electrochemical electrodes;electrochemical sensors;electrochemistry;fluorescence;graphene;optical sensors;oxidation;pH;spectrochemical analysis;voltammetry (chemical analysis)","alkaline solutions;micromolar concentration levels;graphene screen-printed electrodes;pH effect;bioanalytes;biochemistry;irreversible one-step electrochemical oxidation;fluorescent dye;optical measurements;electrochemical measurements;electrochemically active compound;fluorescein detection;spectrofluorimetry;differential pulse voltammetry;ophthalmology;environment protection;voltage 0.0 V to 1.4 V;C","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers have been realised emitting at a single wavelength where the grating structure is etched into the sidewall of the ridge. The main motivation in developing these lasers is for the cooling of ions in atomic clocks; however their feasibility for optical communications is also explored. Narrow linewidth lasers are desirable and this paper will explore how this is achieved. Data rates in excess of 1 Gbit/s have also been achieved in a directly modulated, unfiltered system.

As communication medium and source of aesthetic experience., music is not usually associated with noise - a term denoting an unwanted, annoying sound - therefore the sound levels of music are not monitored in most venues. As a result, both the personnel and the audience are often exposed to sound levels from loudspeakers or headphones that pose a high risk of hearing damage. In this paper we propose a solution intended to reduce the risk of hearing damage by predicting the daily noise exposure level (LEX, 8 h) and automatically limiting the level of reproduced sound. Both the prediction method and the sound level controller are based on the concept of a first-order prediction model GM(l,l) derived from the grey systems theory (GST).

Shoot-through states with one, two, and three phase legs are investigated and observed processes, such as an unintentional “snubber effect” of nonswitched MOSFETs, are described for the first time.

Thus, alternative control targets giving non-oscillatory electromagnetic torque are analyzed and realized in the control. The commanded variables are electromagnetic torque Tem and alternatively, the qs component of stator instantaneous power or a new variable zs calculated in the same way as the qs component of power but the amplitudes of each voltage harmonics are reduced k-times, where k is the harmonic order.

The simple model shows wave propagation through nonlinear multilayer grating in an optical way (without the need to use complex methods). A new behavior of output intensity versus input intensity in such a structure has been obtained for the first time. At the beginning, the structure is examined without taking into account the gain and loss saturation. In this case, the characteristics of reflection and transmission coefficients, and eigenvalues of S matrix are obtained as a function of geometrical parameters of Bragg gratings. The characteristics reveal special points, discussed later, where the structure is PT-symmetric or has a broken symmetry phase. In the first case, the amplitudes of both waves, travelling in opposite directions, do not change, which corresponds to the unimodularity of the S matrix eigenvalues. In the other case, the increase of one amplitude forces the decrease of the other one, and the eigenvalues have reciprocal magnitudes. For these points, the systematic study including the gain and loss saturation effects is conducted. The obtained characteristics illustrate the influence of the saturation intensities on the output intensities, reflection and transmission coefficients, and eigenvalues of S matrix for the incident plane wave with a given intensity. The characteristics demonstrate strong nonreciprocal response and the bistable behavior of the structure. Moreover, for certain values of Bragg gratings geometrical parameters, the investigated structure transits from broken symmetry phase to a PT-symmetric one.","1558-1713","","10.1109/JQE.2017.2761380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063405","Gratings;integrated optics;nonlinear optics","Bragg gratings;Integrated optics;Optical losses;Nonlinear optics","","","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although Hamilton's canonical equations exhibit many advantageous features compared to their acceleration-based counterparts, it appears that there is a lack of dedicated parallel algorithms for multirigid body system dynamics based on this formulation. Serial kinematic chains are considered in this paper. Initially, the standard set of Hamilton's canonical equations is joined together with constraint equations at the velocity level. The reformulation determines the system's joint velocities and constraint force impulses in a divide and conquer manner resulting in logarithmic numerical cost for parallel implementation. Subsequently, the equations of motion are rearranged in order to obtain the time derivatives of the total joint momenta. In the case of the sequential implementation, the entire algorithm exhibits linear computational cost. Presented numerical method is exact and noniterative. Numerical test cases reveal negligible energy drift without the use of any additional constraint stabilization techniques. The results are compared against more standard acceleration based formulation and the outcome from real-life physical experiment.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2017.2654507","National Science Centre of Poland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857090","Mechanical systems;motion analysis;numerical simulation;open-loop systems;parallel algorithms;robot motion","Mathematical model;Heuristic algorithms;Force;Kinematics;Algorithm design and analysis;Robots;Vehicle dynamics","computational complexity;divide and conquer methods;dynamics;kinematics;mechanical engineering computing;parallel algorithms;recursive estimation","parallel recursive Hamiltonian algorithm;forward dynamics;serial kinematic chains;multibody system dynamics;Hamiltons canonical equations;logarithmic numerical cost;motion equations;time derivatives;linear computational cost;divide-and-conquer algorithm","","8","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the main drawbacks of such radars is the occurrence of the masking effect, when a weak target echo is masked by the sidelobes of a strong target echo. The sidelobes of the ambiguity function emerge on the level of the time-bandwidth product below the main peak and are spread in the entire range-Doppler plane. While most approaches to mitigate the masking effect focus on the processing of the received signal, it is possible to move the computation burden to the waveform design phase. This paper describes a filter-based method of creating noise-like waveforms that have very low sidelobes in the area of certain range and Doppler shifts.

In this context, it is usually assumed that energy purchased within a (long-term) contract will be cheaper than energy purchased from the market (whenever needed). Hence, over-use of energy (going over the energy consumption limit, established in the contract), will result in purchase of additional energy and thus should be avoided. In this context, let us also assume that, in a smart home, devices are turned on and off by a centralized control mechanism. Furthermore, individual households can express preferences when each of their devices is to be used. In this case, the question that needs to be answered is: how to schedule devices in a way that will be satisfactory to the users (households) and match the parameters of the contract.

The applicability of regularized methods for differentiation of measurement data in that system is assessed using both synthetic and real-world data. The central-difference method is used as a comparative reference.

Furthermore, those results indicate that estimates of the standard deviation of errors corrupting the depth-data-based position estimates should be used for the adjustment of the regularization parameters.","2377-9322","978-1-5090-4253-1","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2017.7995332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995332","fall detection;depth sensor;healthcare;numerical differentiation","Monitoring;Standards;Kalman filters;Senior citizens;Numerical models;Smoothing methods;Data models","assisted living;differentiation;health care;spatial variables measurement","regularized numerical differentiation;depth-sensor data;care services;elderly persons;disabled persons;nonintrusive fall detection;mass center trajectory;velocity estimation;regularized methods;synthetic data;real-world data;central-difference method;false alarms;depth-data-based position estimation","","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the formation problem is converted to a trajectory tracking problem and a reference trajectory is generated for each follower. then, a tracking controller from the literature is employed to drive the robots towards their corresponding desired trajectories and thus the formation is achieved. Note that the desired orientation for each follower is selected such that the nonholonomic constraint of the robot is respected and thus, the reference trajectory for each follower will be feasible. In order to assess this control strategy, a ROS-framework is developed to conduct real experiments using four ROS-enabled mobile robots TURTLEBOTs. The main practical drawback of the leader-follower approach is the leader fault. Therefore, we investigate ROS ability to keep the formation in case of a leader failure by modifying the formation and dynamically switching the leader during the experiment.","2576-3555","978-1-7281-0521-5","10.1109/CoDIT.2019.8820460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820460","","","mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;position control","leader-follower formation control;multiple nonholonomic ROS-enabled mobile robots;trajectory tracking problem;reference trajectory;tracking controller;control strategy;leader-follower approach;leader fault;ROS ability;TURTLEBOT","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extraction of features is the one of most important stage that can be performed using various approaches, such as appearance-based methods, local descriptor methods or convolutional neural networks. Lately, convolutional neural networks (CNN) become very popular. CNN is a structure based on various filtering layers to reduce size, extract features and finally to classify the input data. This technique allows to efficiently process large datasets. Extracted features can be used to perform multiclass classification or identity verification.

The paper introduces and presents a model of a conflict that is specifically constructed for the allocation of Armed Forces' components based on the measures defined for dimensioning and testing the reference modules' capability to fire. The method of allocation of the fire capability to respond to the threatening scenarios is based on our own specific method in the area of computational intelligence. We have tested different ways to evaluate the optimisation process. The capabilities' measures of weapon systems for different participants of probable conflicts and some important parameters (like terrain or type of operation factors) are defined and presented.

Four stationary transmitters are placed on an unmanned ground vehicle. A mobile transmitter, mounted on a tripod, is used for position marking. The vehicle remained stationary, while the transmitter was moved across a known route over the field. Positions of a transmitter in the horizontal plane are determined and compared with the designated route. Location distribution for several real positions is shown.

The Holevo limit exceeds substantially the standard Shannon limit when the power spectral density of noise acquired in the course of propagation is small compared to the energy of a single photon at the carrier frequency per unit time-bandwidth area.

The design is scalable, because an antenna array with required radiation pattern can be designed by using adequate number of linear sub-arrays. A novel cone-shaped transition surrounding the probe feed has been applied to decrease an inductive reactance of the input impedance. The antenna array composed of four linear sub-arrays has been designed, fabricated and measured to validate performance of the proposed low-cost design. The measured gain of a fabricated antenna is >26 dBi and the reflection coefficient is better than -10 dB. Each sub-array has a separate coaxial connector, therefore beam scanning can be achieved by controlling radio frequency signals in each sub-array. Two methods of beam scanning, a phased array approach and a time modulation approach, have been proposed and compared in terms of efficiency, cost and functionality.","1751-8733","","10.1049/iet-map.2017.0205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8221922","","","antenna phased arrays;antenna radiation patterns;array signal processing;electric connectors;linear antenna arrays;microstrip antenna arrays;modulation","time modulation approach;phased array approach;radio frequency signals;coaxial connector;cone-shaped transition;radiation pattern;ground plane;linear subarrays;X-band antenna array;low-cost beam scanning;low-cost beamforming system;microstrip antenna array;antenna structure","","2","32","","","","","IET","IET Journals"

For this reason research and development of countermeasures against such attacks is very important. This paper presents an environment designed to facilitate research, development and evaluation of countermeasures protecting hardware implementation of cryptographic primitives against side-channel attacks based on power consumption analysis. The environment is composed of hardware cryptographic coprocessor with modular architecture, data transfer and configuration layers and software testbench for design verification. Different crypto primitives (block ciphers, hash functions, checksum) were implemented along with basic countermeasures. Utilized methods of power consumption approximation are also described. Evaluation of capabilities of the entire environment prove that both, hardware architecture and testbench provide easily extensible and versatile framework for research and development of countermeasures against power-based side-channel attacks.","","978-83-63578-16-9","10.23919/MIXDES.2019.8787062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787062","cryptanalysis;differential power analysis;side-channel attacks","Coprocessors;Power demand;Computer architecture;Ciphers;Side-channel attacks;Hardware","coprocessors;cryptography;power aware computing","modular architecture;secure data transmission;secure cryptographic algorithm;information leak;hardware implementation;cryptographic primitives;power consumption analysis;hardware cryptographic coprocessor;data transfer;configuration layers;power consumption approximation;hardware architecture;information processing systems;software testbench;power-based side-channel attacks countermeasures;crypto primitives","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Obtained results show that the movement of a curling stone has a high-frequency noise-like nature, which is likely to be caused by the stick-slip mechanism between the granite stone and the pebbled ice surface.","","978-1-5386-4107-1","10.1109/COE.2018.8435175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8435175","curling stone;inertial measurements;sports measurements sports engineering;curling;stick-slip mechanism;pivot;slide;inertial measurement unit;dynamics of curling stones","Temperature measurement;Ice;Sensors;Accelerometers;Measurement units;Acceleration","acceleration measurement;accelerometers;gyroscopes;rocks;rotation measurement","winter Olympic sport;inertial measurement unit;curling stone handle;pebbled ice surface;granite stones;acceleration measurement;rotation measurement;curling stone movement measurements;accelerometers;gyroscope;stick-slip mechanism;mass 20 kg","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the amplitudes of current harmonics generated by railway vehicles should fulfil the assumed limits. This paper presents the process of determining the optimized modulation technique for VSI with IM. The aim of the work was to determine a switching strategy for VSI with respect to the dc-link current harmonics limits established for railway applications. The presented procedure is a combination of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and analytical frequency-domain approach for dc-link current harmonics calculation. It allows combining restrictions on harmonics in DC-link and in windings of the motor during a single optimization process. For calculations of dc-link current harmonics, the convolution of VSI output current and voltage harmonics was utilized and described. The developed modulation technique was applied in a laboratory scale VSI drive. Finally, the validity of theoretical consideration was confirmed by comparing the analytical results and laboratory measurements. The optimized switching strategy is suitable for application in the railway vehicles supplied with DC traction systems.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2019.2946543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870248","DC-link current;harmonics convolution;PSO;SHE;traction vehicle;voltage source inverter","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Optimization;Inverters;Switches;Rail transportation;Modulation","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Beam steering devices based on liquid crystals usually work either as digital beam steerers (phase gratings), or as analog steerers (prisms). Digital steerers move laser beams to fixed positions; they cannot be tuned continuously. Analog beam steerers produce a continuous angular deviation of laser beams but with very limited deviation angles. In this paper, we developed a tunable grating prism, that can work as a prism and as a phase grating at the same time. This combination of refractive and diffractive effects is achieved with multilayer indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode matrices in a liquid crystal device. This solution is completely different from previous approaches, like blaze gratings or Fresnel configurations - the tunability range here is completely continuous, or completely stepped, or a combination of both at the same time - as there are no interpixels or dead areas in the multilayer configuration. The proposed grating prism is able to deviate a light beam to a large fixed angle by diffraction, and then fine tune the beam over small angle ranges by refraction. Additionally, the light losses produced by ITO diffraction in conventional liquid crystal gratings are significantly reduced using the layered configuration.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2019.2898010","POLONEZ; National Science Center, Poland; European Union's Horizon 2020; Marie Skłodowska-Curie; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636910","Beam steering;diffraction gratings;liquid crystal devices;liquid crystals;prisms;photonic devices","Electrodes;Gratings;Laser beams;Diffraction gratings;Diffraction;Indium tin oxide;Optical refraction","diffraction gratings;indium compounds;light diffraction;liquid crystal devices;liquid crystals;optical multilayers;optical prisms;optical tuning;refractive index;tin compounds","photonic applications;optical functions;beam steering devices;digital beam steerers;phase grating;analog steerers;digital steerers;laser beams;fixed positions;analog beam steerers;continuous angular deviation;deviation angles;tunable grating prism;refractive effects;diffractive effects;multilayer indium tin oxide electrode matrices;liquid crystal device;blaze gratings;tunability range;multilayer configuration;light beam;fixed angle;ITO diffraction;conventional liquid crystal gratings;diffractive liquid crystal devices;refractive liquid crystal devices;tunable photonic devices;self-organized materials;ITO","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of the output signal obtained for a short safety margin depends on how the substation is configured. In the breaker-and-a-half configuration, this output signal is used to speed up the opening of all adjacent circuit breakers. In substations with the dual (or triple) busbar configuration the output signal obtained with a short safety margin is used to speed up the busbar splitting.

Alterations in chromosome structure can disrupt interactions between gene promoters and their regulatory elements or place genes in an inappropriate chromosomal domain. Evaluation of the impact of such genomic aberrations on gene expression has been often neglected, especially when other structural variants (SVs) affecting genes are detected. Another reason for not considering such rearrangements has been the lack of appropriate methods or tools to visualize and prioritize the neighboring genes according to their clinical relevance.To address these challenges, we developed TADeus, an easy-to-use open-source web application dedicated for clinical evaluation of variants in genes whose expression may be affected by chromosomal rearrangements. The main functionality of TADeus provides a view of regulatory landscape of regions surrounding breakpoints of the rearrangements by combing chromatin conformation data (Hi-C) with other omics data. TADeus prioritizes genes using number of interrupted enhancer-promoter interactions, the distance from the breakpoints, the phenotypic data, and haploinsufficiency scores. In addition, TADeus can serve as a genomic browser that shows Hi-C matrices with one-dimensional genomic data and allows users to compare Hi-C data from different tissues.","","978-1-5386-5488-0","10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8621301","Topologically Associating Domain;chromosomal rearrangement;balanced chromosomal rearrangement;chromatin conformation;position effect;clinical genetics","Bioinformatics;Genomics;Diseases;Databases;Browsers;Tools","cellular biophysics;DNA;genetics;genomics;medical computing;molecular biophysics","chromosomal rearrangements;chromatin conformation data;TADeus prioritizes genes;interrupted enhancer-promoter interactions;phenotypic data;one-dimensional genomic data;TADeus-a tool;clinical interpretation;chromatin organization;noncoding regions;abnormal phenotype;position effects;chromosome structure;gene promoters;regulatory elements;place genes;inappropriate chromosomal domain;genomic aberrations;gene expression;structural variants affecting genes;neighboring genes;clinical relevance;open-source web application;clinical evaluation;genes whose expression","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unknown propagation constant of the transmission line and the load reflection coefficient are then determined simultaneously with the VNA calibration coefficients. We compare our method with the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) method and show that both methods yield similar results. Our new multireflect-thru method is solely based upon dimensional parameters of the calibration standards. Therefore, like the multiline TRL method, it can be used to establish a traceable VNA calibration. Thus, the multireflect-thru method constitutes an alternative to the multiline TRL calibration in environments in which the use of transmission lines is troublesome, such as in the case of VNAs with very small coaxial and waveguide connectors.

Large-scale production requires multiple operations to be processed at the same time, so the establishment of the autonomous machining is a significant and rather complex. Not only the machining operation but also autonomous data processing and transmission together with data management is here crucial. The data must be collected in the real-time. In robotized factories, the visual monitoring of the automatized machining processes is needed. We devote to automatize of the welding operation for production of the sea ports cranes. The work-pieces are here big and heavy. Therefore, the development of a system for information processing and management of automated processing welding robots can effectively solve the unified planning and data and image monitoring during production operations, which will improve the processing efficiency of large components.

The experimental results reveal different behavior of two types of the sensor devices. For the interpretation of these dissimilarities numerical simulations of the JLFET electrical characteristics have been used. Based on the experimental data and on the modeling, a problem of the EM energy transport efficiency in the FETs has been discussed, which is one of the key factors limiting the FET sensitivity to the THz radiation.

The method is based on the postulate of the existence of donor bands. In our model, the donor bands are assumed to have a Gaussian distribution of density of states characterized by two fitting parameters only: mean value of energy and standard deviation. By using Kronig's-Penney's model, we have estimated mean values of electron's wave vector module in donor bands. This enables the numerical estimation of the donor band electron mobility (DBEM) caused by polarized optical phonon scattering at room temperatures. At 77 K, DBEM is determined by electron scattering in smooth potential caused by fluctuations in the impurity concentration rather than in individual impurity potentials. Conduction band (CB) electron mobility (CBEM) is determined by scattering on ionized impurities (IO) and polar optical phonon scattering. In calculating of IO scattering, the Brooks-Herring theory was applied with modified values of static dielectric constant. Calculated values of DBEM are almost one order of magnitude below CBEM at 77 K.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2018.2871270","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; Australian Research Council; Australian National Fabrication Facility; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8490229","CdHgTe;donor bands;electron mobility","Impurities;Scattering;Electron mobility;Electric potential;Numerical models;Optical polarization;Electron optics","cadmium compounds;conduction bands;electron mobility;electronic density of states;Gaussian distribution;II-VI semiconductors;impurity distribution;Kronig-Penney model;mercury compounds;permittivity;phonons;semiconductor doping","polar optical phonon scattering;narrow-gap n-type Hg1-xCdxTe structures;Gaussian distribution;density of states;mean value of energy;standard deviation;Kronig's-Penney's model;electron wave vector module;polarized optical phonon scattering;impurity concentration;conduction band electron mobility;ionized impurities;Brooks-Herring theory;static dielectric constant;individual impurity potentials;electron scattering;donor band electron mobility;two-electron conduction;DBEM;IO scattering;temperature 77.0 K;temperature 293 K to 298 K;Hg1-xCdxTe","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the resonant frequency of the transmitter side can be changed assuring high efficiency of the system in a wide range of coupling coefficients i.e. distances between transmitter and receiver.","","978-1-5090-4454-2","10.1109/APWC.2017.8062278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8062278","","Transmitters;Couplings;RLC circuits;Receivers;Magnetic resonance;Capacitance","directional couplers;inductive power transmission;magnetic resonance","wireless power transfer system;magnetic resonant coupling;directional coupler;wireless power transmission system;coupled resonant circuits;resonant frequency;observed reflection frequency characteristic;PWT system operation;coupling coefficients;WPT;directional coupled inductances","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of this approach called (FSIFT: Fractional-SIFT) is inspired by the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) proposed by Lowe and can be viewed as a certain generalization of this formula. The classical SIFT detector is implemented efficiently by using a difference of Gaussian (DoG) functions applied to image, in order to identify potential interest points. This difference is an approximation of the LoG (Laplacian of Gaussians) operator, which can be treated as the sum of the second order derivatives of the Gaussian image. In our method we take advantage of the fractional order derivative performed on the Gaussian images. In order to extract distinctive invariant features we have omitted the step of calculating DoG images. Instead of it, we have applied the fractional derivatives of different orders not far from the values of two. We have chosen the robust and efficient method of calculating the fractional order derivative using the Fourier domain. Many practical experiments have been performed. The promising results of our approach have been compared with the results of application of the well known algorithms like SURF and SIFT.","2326-0319","978-83-62065-30-1","10.23919/SPA.2017.8166891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8166891","","Fourier transforms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Dogs;Approximation algorithms;Robustness","approximation theory;feature extraction;transforms","fractional order derivative;Fractional order method;image keypoints detection;characteristic image point detection;Fractional-SIFT;Scale-Invariant Feature Transform;classical SIFT detector;Gaussian image;DoG images;robust method;second order derivatives;FSIFT;difference of Gaussian functions;Laplacian of Gaussians operator;distinctive invariant features;Fourier domain","","1","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research in the field of floodlighting has also focused on other aspects of this type of lighting in recent years. The energy efficiency issue and the impact on light pollution are the most crucial aspects. These issues have not yet been properly explored in the literature. Significant factors which affect the issue of the engineering aspect of floodlighting have to be determined and studied carefully because of their high importance. The main aim of this paper is to present the key factors which have a crucial impact on energy efficiency and light pollution in the field of floodlighting. These factors are: the direction and location of the lighting equipment, luminous intensity distribution, light output ratio, the method of floodlighting and the spectral power distribution of a light source, as well as the spectral distribution of the reflectance from the illuminated surface. Each of these factors are precisely commented on. These are presented by means of a calculation, a measurement or a visualization example, which clearly allow the crux of the problem to be analysed in the easiest way. The research shows that the problem of improving floodlighting design in respect of energy efficiency and light pollution is a complex and exacting problem for a lighting designer. It definitely requires the creation of an individual and unified system of assessment. It ought to take into account all the crucial factors and be simple, understandable and easy to use. Development of such a system is underway at the Lighting Technology Division of Warsaw University of Technology.

New generation of vector network analyzers (VNA), which are very well known in microwave band, allow measurements in frequency domain up to 1.5 THz with very high dynamics above 90 dB. Moreover, the amplitude and the phase of signals can be measured at 32001 frequency points with 1 Hz resolution. These advantages create new opportunities in frequency domain characterization of different types of materials, both lossless and lossy. In this paper a new broadband measurement technique suitable for far infrared range is presented.

The small surface and the relatively simple structure have a controversial effect. In a positive way, these features provide faster processing compared to face detection and make detection easier compared to fingerprints. On the other side, like other biometrics, current ear biometric recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks. A spoofing attack occurs at sensor level and every impostor can masquerade as someone else by altering data, thus, obtaining an illegitimate access. Due to a lack of anti-spoofing databases, that would support this paper, ear fake databases have been built using different mobile phones. In this paper, an ear presentation attack detection database is collected which contains a various range of variations of potential attacks. In particular, the database consists of two main parts, a) AMI dataset which has 700 ear images and we make display attack by using them, b) data collected at University of Tabriz containing 20 genuine subjects and fake ears which are made from the genuine ears. Different mobile phones are used for collecting the database. Three fake ear attacks are implemented which include video attack, printed attack, and display attack. Consequently, for each subject, 2 videos (left and right ears), 8 different images, and the final database contain 10 video clips and 160 images are prepared. General Image Quality Assessment is used as a baseline algorithm for comparison which is used vastly in the liveness detection purpose. Releasing the first database in ear liveness detection can open new ways for investigating on ear biometrics systems more confidently to use future research on mobile smartphones.","2153-0742","978-1-5386-7931-9","10.1109/CCST.2018.8585637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585637","ear recognition systems;spoofing attack;Image Quality Assessment;liveness detection","Ear;Databases;Mobile handsets;Cameras;Image quality;Biometrics (access control);Protocols","biometrics (access control);ear;face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","fake ears;genuine ears;fake ear attacks;video attack;printed attack;liveness detection purpose;ear liveness detection;ear biometrics systems;ear anti-spoofing database;face detection;current ear biometric recognition systems;spoofing attack;anti-spoofing databases;ear fake databases;ear presentation attack detection database;potential attacks;ear images;mobile phones;AMI dataset;general image quality assessment","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first stage is based on a novel chaotic circuit, which utilizes time as a continuous random variable in a feedback loop. The second stage is based on metastability; however, in contrast to known digital solutions, a flip-flop is stimulated by chaotic initial conditions. The advantage of chaotic behavior is the circuit's immunity to active injection side-channel attacks (e.g., a frequency attack). The circuit design parameters can also vary in a wide range, which makes the TRNG insensitive to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) conditions and tolerance. Moreover, the design is extremely simplified, and therefore, feasible to implement in simple and inexpensive reprogrammable devices (no digital clock manager, programmable delay line, or phase locked loop are required). The TRNG ensures a constant (synchronous) 1-Mb/s bit rate output without additional post-processing. The randomness tests prove a high quality of an output bit stream, which is relatively high when compared with other solutions based on similar hardware resources.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2017.2751144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051063","TRNG;randomness;metastability;chaotic circuit;CPLD;FPGA;programmable devices;ring-oscillator;resolve time;flip-flop;side-channel attacks;frequency attack;NIST tests","Integrated circuit modeling;Chaotic communication;Hardware;Generators;Random variables;Ring oscillators;Mathematical model","chaos;circuit stability;flip-flops;random number generation","random chaotic source;chaotic circuit;feedback loop;chaotic initial conditions;circuit design parameters;true random number generator;flip-flop resolve time instability;TRNG insensitivity;metastability","","3","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study we analyzed shift of the resonance wavelength for LPG after its functionalization with DNA layer and during DNA hybridization. It has seen found that the LPG is able to be functionalized with DNA oligonucleotide, acting as a probe and after the functionalization can selectively bind specific complementary DNA oligonucleotides in a very low concentration.

As a consequence of the first trend, the relevance of small satellites in line with the “cheaper and faster”philosophy is increasing. The second one opens up completely new horizons by enabling the design of architectures aimed at improving the performance, reliability, and efficiency of current and future space missions. The EU H2020 ONION project (“Operational Network of Individual Observation Nodes”) has leveraged on the concept of fractionated and federated satellite systems (FFSS) to develop and design innovative mission architectures resulting in a competitive advantage for European earth observation (EO) systems. Starting from the analysis of emerging needs in the European EO market, the solutions to meet these needs are identified and characterized by exploring FFSS. In analogy with terrestrial networks, these systems envision the distribution of satellite functionalities amongst multiple cooperating spacecrafts (nodes of a network), possibly independent, and flying on different orbits. FFSS are considered by many as the future of space-based infrastructures, as they offer a pragmatic, progressive, and scalable approach to improve existing and future space missions.

In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, one of the most pressing requirements is for situational awareness (SA) so that resources, including personnel and supplies, may be prioritized to have the most impact and help those in the most need. As the recovery operations continue, the SA needs to be continuously updated based on changing conditions in the affected areas. There are many sources of information to provide SA, including reporting by the victims of the disaster as well as observations made by responding personnel. In this context, SA can be significantly enhanced via information obtained from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, especially in a smart city environment.

Initially, the algorithm extracts the propagation constant of printed coplanar waveguide (CPW) standards by the use of a multiline thru-reflect-line calibration. Then, the proposed algorithm utilizes finite-element modeling to dynamically create an interpolated search space by automatic simulation. The algorithm utilizes a least-square optimization routine to minimize the deviation between the model and the measurements. Our technique significantly reduces the computing resources and is able to extract the material parameters using even a nominal ink profile. Characteristic impedances for CPWs are extracted using series resistor measurements from 10 MHz to 20 GHz. It is shown that the proposed characterization methodology is able to detect small changes in material properties induced by changes in fabrication parameters, such as sintering temperature. Ink conductivities of approximately 2.973 × 107 S/m and a supporting spacer dielectric constant of 1.78 were obtained for the inkjet-printed CPWs on polyethylene terephthalate. In addition, the inkjet-printed CPWs sintered at 170 °C and 220 °C on Kapton had conductivities of 0.187 × 107 and 0.201 × 107 S/m, respectively.

The UE communicates user actions to the edge/cloud via the mobile communication infrastructure; the object is to retrieve the latest game status, of which the most important information is the rendered frame. Particularly, we study reliability through replication in a number of MEC-servers, timeliness through Age of Information (AoI) and load reduction by leveraging the X2 interface at the edge, in order to abort useless frame rendering computations. We translate it as a scenario where a sink - representing the UE - is interested in the freshest possible update from distributed nodes. Each node sends updates following a Last Come First Served (LCFS) policy with preemption. We consider two scenarios; the first is n parallel LCFS systems sending updates, and the second adds a feedback loop aimed at decreasing the number of jobs sent per second by the nodes, thus decreasing the load per node. We analyze the number of jobs sent per second and average peak Age of Information at the sink, showing that the second scheme achieves a significantly lower rate of jobs compared with the first, while maintaining constant AoI, thus reducing the load at the edge. We also find that using the feedback loop, we achieve the maximum saving in transmitted jobs per second when the average arrival rate per system is equal to the inverse of the average busy time in every node.","2374-9628","978-1-7281-1025-7","10.1109/IPCCC47392.2019.8958728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8958728","Age of information;Queuing theory;Cloud gaming;Edge computing","","cellular radio;cloud computing;computer games;mobile communication;mobile computing;quality of service;rendering (computer graphics);telecommunication traffic;video streaming","distributed nodes;freshest possible update;useless frame rendering computations;MEC-servers;rendered frame;mobile communication infrastructure;user actions;UE;user equipment;cloud gaming;load reduction","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, the accident hazard in Poland is characterized by the highest numbers of the killed in road accidents in the EU. The possibilities of inferring reasonable conclusions in this field from a comparative analysis of changes in the accident hazard in two age groups, i.e. 18-24 and 60+, have been shown. The hazard indicator values have also been referred to the overall values calculated for all the age groups taken as a whole. The territorial distribution of the accident hazard for the elderly has also been sought. For this purpose, the method of ranking of individual regions (defined as voivodships, i.e. administrative province areas) has been used.

In order to cover torque demand of common drive cycles with single gear transmission, a very wide field weakening operation range is necessary. This paper introduces a modified per unit system description, which takes advantage of a novel definition of base quantities. The presented method allows easy assessment of PMSM drive torque curve shape in the field weakening region based on only two variables, i.e., the drive characteristic factor and the electrical machine saliency factor. These two factors are also sufficient to describe all qualitatively different torque vs. speed curve shapes, which can be achieved using PMSM variable speed drives. It is a well known fact that the motor power factor affects inverter power rating and its current demand. The presented approach links this dependency with a particular qualitative drive torque vs. speed curve shape. It allows further to predict machine equivalent circuit parameters and the inverter power rating for every feasible torque vs. speed curve shape meeting particular application requirements. This method provides then an analytical basis for preliminary system design and dimensioning.","","978-1-7281-3703-2","10.1109/EVER.2019.8813512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813512","permanent magnet synchronous motor;field weakening;torque curve;motor saliency","","battery powered vehicles;electric vehicle charging;equivalent circuits;gears;invertors;permanent magnet motors;power factor;synchronous motor drives;torque;variable speed drives","torque production capability;field weakening region;permanent magnet synchronous motor;torque demand;single gear transmission;PMSM drive torque curve shape;PMSM variable speed drives;motor power factor;inverter power rating;current demand;machine equivalent circuit parameters;battery electric vehicle traction;BEV traction","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This raises a question whether this phenomenon also occurs on smaller datasets and simpler network architectures.

This work presents the model, control scheme, and experimental validation of a configuration, which is able to interface medium-voltage high-power multigenerator marine energy conversion systems to the grid at medium-voltage high-power levels. The configuration is based on a two-step rectifier/boost converter for each generator and a multilevel inverter that merges and manages the multiple power outputs from the multigenerator section of the system.

Robots that will work with people in the future will be an increasingly common image not only in factories but also in our homes. This goal creates a challenge for engineers and scientists. This challenge is not only to develop safe and reliable mechanical design and control systems that will provide high quality of performed task but also to create safe systems for interacting with human being. One of the possible solution for it is to integrate into structure of robot so called elastic actuators instead of classic stiff actuators. Increasing popularity of elastic actuators results from the fact that those actuators have many positive attributes in relation to classic stiff actuators. Such features are: increased shock tolerance, easier positional control in the contact issues, easier force control (which can be directly reduced to a position control problem) or high back driveability (used in tele-manipulation process or programing by hand in robotic arms). In this paper we present a position control method for Variable Stiffness Elasticity Actuator. To achieve this goal, we modelled such actuator using discrete state-space approach, first. Parameters of model used in simulations were defined with use of prototype concept of this actuator. Control method utilizes a Model Predictive Control approach to calculate input to the DC motor. Using Model Predictive Control approach we optimize changes of control variable along prediction horizon. We also present a method on how to select stiffness of the system while taking into account maximum possible values of physical spring. In our paper we present simulation of three possible types of input: step function, smooth velocity step function and sinusoidal function. Obtained results of quality of regulation for MPC are compared to PID regulator.","","978-1-5386-6143-7","10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8388341","","Actuators;Springs;Robots;Regulators;Mathematical model;DC motors;Elasticity","actuators;DC motors;elasticity;force control;manipulators;position control;predictive control;springs (mechanical);state-space methods;telerobotics;three-term control","control systems;shock tolerance;force control;model predictive control approach;robotics;discrete state-space approach;prototype concept;DC motor;prediction horizon;smooth velocity step function;sinusoidal function;MPC;PID regulator;position control problem method;reliable mechanical design;variable stiffness elasticity actuator;classic stiff actuators","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two version of SLID were applied: one stage process at 350°C and two stage process short time at 280 °C + long time at 180°C. Second process is divided into two steps: short high temperature (280°C) step for melting Sn and initial intermetallic compound formation and long low temperature (180°C) step for solid state diffusion process. Design of experiments technique was used for process optimization. The best process parameters were obtained and they were applied for monocrystalline GaN chips assembly to DBC substrates. In the long-term stability tests at 300°C it was proven that both versions of investigated SLID technique can be applied for monocrystalline GaN chips assembly.

Combustion process is a complex MIMO process (Multi-Input-Multi-Output). A large inertia and non-linearity of the combustion combined with frequent changes of disturbance signals like boiler load and fuel quality necessitated the searching for new solutions in the field of control and optimization. There are plenty of algorithms used for combustion optimization, ranging from MPC through neural network etc. Most of the algorithms ae inspired by phenomenon that could be observed in the nature. The newest algorithm, that has been successfully applied in combustion optimization project is artificial immune system. The artificial immune system like real immune system has ability of adaptation. Once a body is infected by a known pathogen (bacteria or virus) the immune response - antibody production is much faster and the illness is less painful to the body, compering to infection by a new pathogen. Artificial immune system is a self-learning algorithm - it searches and remembers most effective solutions for specific process conditions. The advantage of IT system with artificial immune algorithm is ability of fast adaptation to continuously changing conditions with multi-criteria optimization. The artificial immune algorithm has been applied combustion optimization projects in miscellaneous hard coal, lignite, gas and oil fired power boilers with capacity ranging from 300 t/h to 2300 t/h.

The method can use any user-generated network traffic as hidden transmission channel. It utilizes overwriting TCP segments payload without recalculating checksums. Therefore, a segment after reaching its target is considered incorrect and it can be taken over to extract hidden data. Despite that, the segment is normally retransmitted according to the protocol specification; thanks to this, normal user communication is not affected. Following this idea, the basic mechanisms of this technique were designed and implemented. The testbed environment was prepared to conduct the initial proof-of-concept experiments and to measure basic operational metrics. The average steganographic bandwidth at the level of 2 kB/s was achieved for the conditions ensuring the proper level of undetectability.

This paper represents activities of a robot system using hierarchical Petri nets with conditions. Such net is created by specifying consecutive layers: multi-agent robot system layer, agent layer, subsystem layer, behaviour layer and communication layer. This decomposition not only organizes in a systematic manner the development of a robot system, but also introduces a comprehensive description of concurrently acting subsystems.

The classical cycle based algorithm assumes that a given packet stream can be served only in predefined periods while it is not entitled to receive service in the periods dedicated to serve other packet streams. This property leads to non-work conserving behavior of the system and, as a consequence, rather poor packet transfer characteristics (expressed by packet delay and packet loss ratio in the case of system with a finite buffer). On the other hand, the important advantage of this algorithm is that it guarantees performance isolation among different packet streams. The proposed modification assumes that in the periods dedicated for service of a given packet stream the scheduler can also serve the packets belonging to other streams but with assigned lower priorities. In this way we transform the behavior of the cycle based algorithm to the form of nearly work conserving. In the paper we provide exemplary simulation results showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of packet delay characteristics and guarantees about performance isolation. Finally, we show the application of the studied scheme to the IIP System with virtualized network infrastructure requiring isolation among virtual links sharing a given link capacity.","2474-154X","978-1-5090-6796-1","10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215377","scheduling scheme;cycle based scheduler with alternating priorities;performance isolation;virtualized network infrastructure;virtual links;simulation results","Delays;Simulation;Scheduling algorithms;Time division multiple access;Servers;Transforms","computer networks;quality of service;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","cycle based schedulers;scheduling algorithms;classical cycle based scheme;link capacity;virtual link sharing;virtualized network infrastructure r;IIP system;packet transfer characteristics;packet streams;packet delay characteristics;packet loss ratio;time guard","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To remove errors of the first type, we introduce a novel simple technique of the thru/line symmetrization, which utilizes an additional measurement of the same standard, but reversely connected to the VNA ports. To extract the load mismatch errors, we apply the multiline TRL (Thru-Reflect-Line) calibration as a reference one. To this end we use three common barrels of different lengths acting after their symmetrization as transmission line standards. With the VNA calibrated using the multiline TRL method, we characterize our mismatched load and then utilize its data to our modified TRM calibration. We show that this simple and low-cost approach results in improved accuracy of the TRM calibration.

Different aspects were considered, including normal and quick charging modes, levels of grid penetration and uncontrolled and controlled charging. An analysis of the worldwide experience has revealed that the growing EV market increases the probability of transformer overload and unbalance, leading to its aging.

The proposed system is composed of two identical subnetworks combined by a comparator layer placed on top of them. The base of each subnetwork is a shallow autoencoder (AE) which is further connected with a Multilayer Perceptron. The system is trained in two phases - an unsupervised one - used to create a meaningful feature-based input representation in AE compression layer, and a supervised one - meant for fine-tuning of the whole model. Training and test data are composed of pairs of Bridge deals in which the second deal in a pair is the first one rotated by 90 degrees. Since the task is to point which of the two deals promise a higher contract for the NS pair, due to deal rotation within a pair, the system effectively answers the title question ""Who should bid higher, NS or WE, in a given deal?"". The proposed approach is experimentally compared with two other methods: one relying on a neural system solving the DDBP and the other one employing several estimators of hand strength used by experienced players.

An adequate flow rate is crucial to restore physiological cardiac output. Unfortunately, during clinical heart support, neither blood flows nor pressures can be measured within the device. In general, the flow rate depends on the control parameters and patient conditions. However, the patient's hemodynamic parameters are not constantly monitored. Therefore, blood flow should be evaluated based on the standard measurements from the device control unit. Methods: The model identification data were taken from a research stand consisting of a VAD connected to a hybrid cardiovascular simulator. The studies were conducted under different work and control conditions. A compound model of a ventricular assist device was proposed. First, the driving pressure waveform for an idle run of the supply unit is modeled. Next, the blood flow is estimated based on the difference between the measured value of driving pressure and the modeled value for an idle run. Results: The quality of the developed model is good (R̅2̅ = 0.92) and similar for all tested cases, confirming the high versatility of the proposed solution. Conclusion: The blood flow rate is estimated based on standard signals from the device control unit; therefore, no additional measurements are necessary. Significance: The developed model application in the VAD control unit will aid the selection of control parameters and might be useful for the development of the adaptive control system.

However, even nowadays researchers often struggle to effectively model diffusion processes in heterogeneous, complex media, where the most notable example can be fractal structures. The problem can become even more difficult for time-varying non-homogeneous media. Previous researches have shown that variable-order fractional calculus can be extremely useful in this particular area. Using such mathematical methods allows us to consider investigated medium as the homogeneous non-integer order structure, what can greatly decrease computational time without significant loss of accuracy. In the paper a non-integer variable-order model for heat diffusion in 2-dimensional fractal-like structure is presented. The paper addresses the relations between system order and number of iterations of fractal. Various types of order switching methods are investigated. The model is validated with numerical finite element method simulation. For investigated structure the obtained model is both fast and accurate way to predict heat transfer process results in time-varying environment.","","978-1-5386-4762-2","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2018.8399691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399691","fractional calculus;variable-order systems;fractal media;anomalous heat diffusion","Mathematical model;Fractals;Heating systems;Switches;Media;Numerical models;TV","calculus;diffusion;finite element analysis;fractals;heat transfer;partial differential equations","fractional variable-order model;time-varying fractal media;rapid growth;computational power;real-world problems;partial differential equations;nowadays researchers;heterogeneous media;complex media;notable example;fractal structures;nonhomogeneous media;variable-order fractional calculus;mathematical methods;investigated medium;noninteger order structure;computational time;heat diffusion;system order;numerical finite element method simulation;investigated structure;heat transfer process results;time-varying environment;technological progress;diffusion processes","","3","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), we pursue symmetry in the test setup by carefully selecting a way the setup elements are assembled so as minimize impact of signal imbalance. We employ a vector network analyzer to verify properties of our three-port test setup by comparing two groups of its scattering parameters: one simulated with ADS software using S-matrices individually measured for each setup element and the other one determined from one-port calibration measurements in the test setup with tiny short-open-load calibration standards mounted on a TO-8 header.

Three different tunneling path approaches are defined and examined: horizontal path, maximum valence band gradient, and minimum tunneling distance. Double-gate (DG) and single-gate (SG) transistor structures are considered, and effects of the silicon body thickness and the gate-source overlap are investigated. The differently defined tunneling paths lead to significantly different on currents. It is shown that the minimum tunneling distance approach results in the highest tunnel current, whereas the horizontal path approach underestimates the current, especially for thick semiconductor body layers and the SG transistor structures. A choice of the tunneling path approach can be crucial for the accuracy of modeling the drain current of the TFETs.","1557-9646","","10.1109/TED.2018.2821059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334817","Interband tunneling;semiconductor devices;tunnel transistors","Tunneling;TFETs;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Silicon;Numerical models","elemental semiconductors;field effect transistors;numerical analysis;semiconductor device models;silicon;tunnel transistors;tunnelling;valence bands","thick semiconductor body layers;gate-source overlap;silicon body thickness;double-gate transistor structures;single-gate transistor structures;2D semiclassical numerical simulator;TFET;electrical characteristics;tunnel field-effect transistor modelling;minimum tunneling distance approach;tunnel current;SG transistor structures;horizontal path approach;maximum valence band gradient;nonlocal band-to-band tunneling generation model;silicon tunnel field-effect transistor;tunneling path approach;Si","","1","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume that the most tedious part of FTTH network deployment, i.e., trenching and cable installation, is completed, and the operator can start to connect customers to the network. The connecting process still requires expenditures for both passive (splitters) and active (ONUs, OLT cards) equipment. In this paper, we define the problem of rational splitter and OLT card deployment and present the multi-state optimization (MuSO) approach to handle it. MuSO minimizes the expected total cost of deployment using a stochastic model; thus, it optimizes under stochastic behavior. Finally, we compare MuSO to other rational methods, numerically validating its efficiency. We also investigate the impact of various factors-e.g., the take-up rates assumed when designing a network, delays in providing service to newly acquired customers, optimization time limits-on the final FTTH network deployment cost. The presented methodology not only can be used to minimize the deployment cost of FTTH networks, but also to assess the impact of uncertainty on network designs returned by automated methods.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.9.000412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7926826","Access networks;FTTH;PON;Splitter allocation;Uncertainty","Optical fiber subscriber loops;Ports (Computers);Uncertainty;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber cables;Optical fibers;Optical fiber devices","optical communication equipment;optical delay lines;optimisation;passive optical networks;stochastic processes","FTTH networks;OLT card deployment;rational splitter;OLT card installation;fiber-to-the-home networks;multistate optimization approach;stochastic model;optical delays","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Predominantly the power line interferences are cancelled with use of a notch filter with the central frequency 50 or 60 Hz. Due to removal of a part of EEG signal frequency band, a part of information about EEG signal, especially from gamma waves band (35-100 Hz), is lost. The paper focuses on comparison of the adaptive algorithms (LMS, RLS) and the notch filter. The comparison is based on the dedicated measures allowing to assess the distortions (related to loss of information) introduced by the analysed methods both in the whole EEG signal and in the gamma waves band. The results of preliminary studies show that depending on the power of interferences the adaptive filters may introduce less distortions in gamma-band than the notch filter, which may be significant for accurate gamma waves analysis.","","978-1-7281-1715-7","10.1109/SPS.2019.8882014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882014","EEG;gamma waves;adaptive filters;LMS;RLS;notch filter","Electroencephalography;Adaptive filters;Notch filters;Electrodes;Distortion;Resistors","adaptive filters;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;notch filters","adaptive algorithms effectiveness;power line interferences;gamma waves band;electroencephalography signals;notch filter;EEG signal frequency band;adaptive filters;frequency 60.0 Hz;frequency 35.0 Hz to 100.0 Hz;frequency 50 Hz","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although FSO links realize broadband transmission at low cost, their drawback is sensitivity to adverse weather conditions causing transmission degradation on multiple links. Hence, designing such FSO networks requires an optimization model to find the cheapest configuration of link capacities that will be able to carry an acceptable level of the demanded traffic in all weather states that can be foreseen in network operation. Such a model can be achieved using robust optimization techniques, and for that it is important to find a tractable way of characterizing possible link (capacity) degradation states corresponding to weather conditions not known in advance. In the paper we show how weather records can be translated to vectors of link capacity available (after degradation) in particular weather states, and how the resulting link degradation states may be represented mathematically in a compact and tractable way to be exploited in optimization. To solve the second task we will make use of a generalization of a combinatorial problem of finding a minimum hitting set to deduce a compact set approximating a given set of link degradation states. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our model by means of a numerical study.","2576-3539","978-1-7281-4698-0","10.1109/RNDM48015.2019.8949155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949155","free space optics;wireless mesh networks;robust optimization;uncertainty sets;hitting sets","","combinatorial mathematics;free-space optical communication;optimisation;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;wireless mesh networks","transmission degradation;FSO links;weather phenomena;WMN optimization;wireless mesh networks;free space optics;broadband transmission;adverse weather conditions;FSO networks;link capacity;robust optimization;weather records;weather states;link degradation states;combinatorial problem","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DeepIQ is able to learn the underlying principles of solving RMs (the importance of similarity of figures in shape, rotation, size or shading) in a domain-independent way, that allows its subsequent application to test instances constructed based on a different set of figures, never seen before, or another type of IQ problem, with no requirement for additional training. This transfer learning property is of paramount importance due to scarce availability of the real data, and is demonstrated in the paper on two different RM data sets, as well as two distinct types of IQ tasks (solving RMs and odd-one-out problems). Experimental results are promising, excelling human average scores by a large margin on the most challenging subset of RM instances and exceeding 90% accuracy in odd-one-out tests.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8851878","","Shape;Feature extraction;Artificial intelligence;Training;Multilayer perceptrons;Task analysis","feature extraction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","human-inspired AI system;neural network approach;human IQ test problems;DeepIQ system;deep autoencoder;feature-based representation;shallow multilayer perceptrons;transfer learning property;human average scores;odd-one-out tests;Raven's progressive matrices;scoring module;RM data sets","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If g modes are associated with the primary component of θ Oph, then our discovery allows, as in the case of other hybrid pulsators, to infer more comprehensive information on the internal structure. To this aim we perform in-depth seismic studies involving simultaneous fitting of mode frequencies, reproducing mode instability, and adjusting the relative amplitude of the bolometric flux variations. To explain the mode instability in the observed frequency range a significant increase of the mean opacity in the vicinity of the Z-bump is needed. Moreover, constraints on mass, overshooting from the convective core and rotation are derived. If the low-frequency modes come from the speckle B5 companion then taking into account the effects of rotation is enough to explain the pulsational mode instability.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stz639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688920","atomic data;opacity;stars: early-type;stars: individual: θ Oph;stars: oscillations;stars: rotation","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

With FT, end-to-end traffic demands are equipped with dedicated logical tunnels, for example MPLS tunnels, whose nominal capacity is subject to thinning in order to follow the fluctuations of link capacities availability. Moreover, instantaneous traffic of each demand is throttled at its originating node accordingly to the current total capacity available on the demand's dedicated tunnels. In effect, the network is always capable of carrying the admitted traffic. In this paper we deal with an efficient, implementable version of FT, referred to as AFT (affine flow thinning). By deriving appropriate cutting-plane and path-generation algorithms, we show how real-life network dimensioning problems for AFT can be efficiently treated using a proper characterization of the network link availability states. Results of a numerical study illustrate tractability of the cost minimization problems, and assess cost efficiency of AFT in comparison with other protection mechanisms.","2576-3539","978-1-5386-7030-9","10.1109/RNDM.2018.8489835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489835","Traffic protection;robust design;variable link capacity;multicommodity flows;affine routing;FSO","Optimization;Device-to-device communication;Communication networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Linear programming;Telecommunications;Electronic mail","multiprotocol label switching;optimisation;radio links;radio networks;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","flow thinning optimization;traffic protection mechanism;communication networks;variable link capacities;end-to-end traffic demands;dedicated logical tunnels;nominal capacity;link capacities availability;instantaneous traffic;originating node;admitted traffic;AFT;affine flow thinning;path-generation algorithms;real-life network dimensioning problems;network link availability states;protection mechanisms;wireless networks;MPLS tunnels;cutting-plane;cost minimization problems","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In matched-absorbers architecture, the first absorber determinates the thickness of the subsequent active layer, in order to meet equal quantum efficiency in all stages (QE condition). The simulations showed that quantum efficiency, for both types of architectures, decreases, while the detectivity versus number of stages increases. Detectors with equal absorbers (no QE condition) allow to build more stages in the cascade being the possible way to improve detectivity. On the other hand, structures with matched-absorbers show more flexibility in detectivity improvement by optimal selection of individual active layers. It is shown that structures assumed in this paper do not fully exploit the potential offered by the matched-absorbers approach. The optimal absorber selection allows to reach two times higher quantum efficiency.

The analysis of changes in the angular positions and in the relative velocities of the vehicles during their right-angle collision was undertaken to determine the initial values necessary for the modelling of the post-impact phase of the vehicle motion (after the end of the vehicle contact phase). The analysis was based on results of special crash tests carried out to the FMVSS 214 procedure. The results of the calculations carried out were taken as a basis for the model of vehicles' kinematics during the phase of vehicle deformation growth.

The CONTIN program is used to analyse the spectral image in that process. Because this method can be considered as ill-posed problem, the received results are imprecise.

Direct calculation of reference alpha/beta components of current vector does not require any synchronization procedure or grid voltage/virtual flux orientation of the reference frame. On the other hand, the proposed control is still as simple in implementation as other vector control methods such as voltage-oriented control or virtual-flux-oriented control. The introduced variable (virtual torque) allows us to calculate reference current vector components in alpha/beta frame without symmetrical components decomposition. The current vector obtained by using the proposed control method has the same asymmetry factor as unbalanced grid voltage. It means that the rectifier is seen by the grid as a resistive load with the same resistance in each phase. For the grid it is preferable target because the phase with the highest voltage is loaded most, while the other phases are less loaded.

On the market, some such hybrid devices are already offered. They are configured as a radio data link with an optional optical one. This optical link operates at the infrared of near infrared (0.75-1.4 μm) or shortwave infrared (1.4-3.0 μm). However, operation in long-wave infrared spectral range is less sensitivity to atmosphere features (determined by visibility and scintillation index) and higher security of data transmission. That is why, it can be very useful in some special operation scenarios. In this paper, preliminary research of a developed model of optical/radio hybrid data link is described.

The initial concept of the Future Planetary Defense System (FPDS) provides for the preparation of computer physical models of the behavior of small celestial bodies including their collisions. The computer concept of the defensive space mission involves the preparation of 3D network- centric subsystems of small space vehicles as autonomous nodes connected by data transmission systems in space. As the leading technologies for connecting nodes into the system, laser and millimeter wave (MMW) technologies are proposed. The nodes of the system - space vehicles - will be equipped with very precise tools to search, detect, track, point and target dangerous asteroids. This part of the concept provides for the simulation of reactions of the defense system to the emergence of the threats to the Earth. It is fundamentally important to synchronize the system with very accurate and stable time signals from atomic and even pulsar clocks. In the scale of Solar System measurements of time, distance and angles, navigation, precise pointing, tracking and guidance are extremely difficult problems. Models of precise on-board atomic and pulsar clocks, and their synchronization are the basic problems of space metrology in their relativistic aspect. This is related to the time dilation phenomenon associated with the movement of clocks and the change in the frequency of emission and reception of signals in the gravitational field. This leads to the necessity of applying these two corrections changing the speed of the clock. We need to consider not only the system sensors, but also actuators. One of the most important aspects for consideration is the future high-power laser to combat small asteroids. The next example is a modern classic warhead to destroy the asteroid structure. In fact, there is a huge number of different problems already known, but the new one is that the computer simulation in the Solar System scale and near here to the Earth, according to the latest IAU resolutions ought to use the predictions of General Relativity in the weak-field limit: Parametrized Post- Post-Newtonian equations of ""slow"" motion. Our computer models of FPDS ought to be simulated in Reference Systems within the framework of General Relativity.","2575-7490","978-1-7281-1344-9","10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2019.8869626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869626","space;relativistic metrology;space missions;planetary defense modeling;pulsar time;navigation;positioning","Mathematical model;Space vehicles;Earth;Planetary orbits;Computer simulation","aerospace instrumentation;asteroids;astronomical techniques;celestial mechanics;general relativity;gravitation;pulsars","Solar System's space;planetary safety;Small Solar System Bodies;future planetary defense system;computer physical models;computer concept;defensive space mission;data transmission systems;space vehicles;stable time signals;precise pointing guidance;tracking guidance;pulsar clocks;system sensors;Solar System scale;Reference Systems;space metrology problems;pulsar time;relativistic metrology","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The size of this dispersion depends on the a transmitting and receiving antenna pattern. In this case, the half power beamwidths (HPBWs) and directions for maximum radiation/reception of antenna patterns may cause increase or decrease of the channel angular dispersion at the receiving point. The EMC assessment with consideration of the transmitter and receiver antenna patterns is based on simulation studies. For modeling propagation phenomena in a multipath environment, a multi-elliptical propagation model is used. This model is based on the transmission characteristics of the channel such as the power delay profile or spectrum (PDP or PDS). Based on PDP/PDS, the ellipses' parameters are determined. These ellipses represent the occurrence locations of radio wave scatterers in the azimuth plane. In this case, the probability density function of angle of departure (PDF of AOD) function is used to modelling the normalized pattern of the transmitting antenna. The PDF of AOD transformation is then the basis for obtaining the power azimuth spectrum (PAS) at the receiving point. At this stage, the receiving antenna pattern are also considered. The measure of the angular dispersion of the received signal is the rms angle spread (AS). AS is based on PAS. The obtained results of the simulations allow to determine the influence of HPBW and the maximum radiation direction of the receiver antenna pattern on AS. This is the basis for the analyzed EMC evaluation.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293448","","Antenna radiation patterns;Electromagnetic compatibility;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas;Dispersion;Mathematical model;Channel models","antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic wave scattering;multipath channels;probability;radiowave propagation;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","received signal;receiving antenna pattern;multielliptical propagation model;multipath propagation environment;electromagnetic compatibility evaluation;transmitting antenna patterns;EMC evaluation;channel angular dispersion;half power beamwidths;HPBW;radio wave scatterers;probability density function;angle of departure;power azimuth spectrum;rms angle spread","","11","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of channel modeling methods available in a literature do not consider the selectivity of the transmitting and receiving antennas. In such cases, we can assume that the modeling is carried out for isotropic or omnidirectional antennas. In this paper, the angular dispersion modeling method for a 5G wireless link with directional antennas is shown what constitutes its novelty.

Evaluation of signal reception direction is used in a method called a direction of arrival (DOA). The DOA is one of the most commonly used location methods in wireless systems. Its important advantage is independence from knowledge of a time-frequency structure of the received signal. Therefore, this method is used primarily in military radio reconnaissance systems and electronic warfare. In this paper, we evaluate errors in determining the DOA resulting from propagation phenomena occurring in an urbanized environment. A maximum power received from a given direction is the basis for the estimation of the DOA in most radio direction-finders. Thus, the direction of maximum radiation of the localized object is important because it causes a change of the extremum in a power azimuth spectrum (PAS). Simulation studies are the basis for assessing the DOA error for the transmitters with the directional antennas. To model the impact of propagation phenomena, a multi-elliptical model is used. This model considers the majority of propagation phenomena occurring in the urbanized environment. The possibility of considering patterns of the transmitting and receiving antenna is its important advantage. In this case, the Gaussian is used to model the pattern of the directional antennas. The assessment of the DOA error is carried out for non-line-of-sight conditions between the receiver and transmitter, i.e., the radio direction-finder and localized object, respectively. In simulation studies, the influence of the transmitting antenna parameters, i.e., its beamwidth and direction of maximum radiation, on a shape of the received PASs and their extremums is considered.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8598174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598174","","Direction-of-arrival estimation;Transmitting antennas;Directional antennas;Directive antennas;Dispersion;Electromagnetics","direction-of-arrival estimation;directive antennas;electronic warfare;radio direction-finding;radio receivers;receiving antennas;transmitting antennas","directional antenna;radio emission source localization;received signal parameters;signal reception direction;military radio reconnaissance systems;propagation phenomena;urbanized environment;radio direction-finder;maximum radiation;localized object;DOA error;receiver;transmitter;transmitting antenna parameters;received PASs;direction of arrival error;location methods","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Empirical studies show that this phenomena significantly influences on an angular dispersion of received signals and hence a quality of a radio link. The effect of this scattering can be minimized by shaping a beam width of a transmitter antenna. In addition, the maximum radiation direction of the emitter antenna is of great importance for the angular dispersion. The assessment of the impact of the transmission antenna pattern on the angular dispersion is obtained on the basis of simulation studies. In this case, the power angular spectrum (PAS) is used to evaluate the angular dispersion of the received signals. Based on PAS, the rms angle spread (AS) is determined. This measure is used to assess the influence of the transmitting antenna radiation pattern on the angular dispersion at the reception point. For modeling a radio channel typical for the urban areas, a multi-ellipsoidal propagation model is used. This model is based on the transmission characteristics of the channel such as the power delay profile or spectrum (PDP or PDS). Based on PDP/PDS, the coaxial ellipsoid parameters are determined. These ellipsoids represent the occurrence locations of radio wave scatterers. The obtained simulation results show the significant impact of the half-power beam width and the maximum radiation direction of antenna pattern on AS, and thus on the quality of the wireless link.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293445","","Dispersion;Channel models;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Electromagnetics;Scattering;Azimuth","antenna radiation patterns;electromagnetic wave scattering;multipath channels;radio links;radiowave propagation;transmitting antennas;wireless channels","angular dispersion;power angular spectrum;received signals;transmitting antenna radiation pattern;urban areas;emitter antenna pattern;rms angle spread;reception point;radio channel;multi-ellopsoidal propagationmodel;power delay profile;power delay spectrum;coaxial ellipsoid parameters;radio wave scatterers;multipath phenomenon;channel scattering;radio link","","2","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The former is used to describe a dispersion of a signal reception angle. The second one illustrates the received signal dispersion in a frequency domain. Usually, estimation methods based on measurements and modeling methods for these channel characteristics are definitely different. This is due to the fact that the PAS reflect a static situation related to one or several measurement points, while the DS corresponds to a dynamic situation obtained during a movement of objects (transmitter or receiver) at a specified route. Despite these differences, a close relationship exists between these characteristics because the Doppler frequency shift is associated with the angle of arrival. In this paper, this relationship and the numerical transformation of the PAS to DS are shown. The presented transformation allows for a quick estimation of the normalized DS shape based on the measured or modeled PAS. The proposed transformation is universal and allows determining the shapes of many DSs depending on the analyzed directions of the object movement based on one PAS only.","","978-88-907018-8-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8739593","propagation;multipath propagation;modeling;numerical transformation;power azimuth spectrum;Doppler spectrum;Doppler effect;dispersion;angle of arrival","Dispersion;Doppler effect;Probability density function;Frequency-domain analysis;Shape;Azimuth;Scattering","correlation methods;direction-of-arrival estimation;Doppler radar;Doppler shift;frequency-domain analysis;radiowave propagation;statistical analysis;wireless channels","static situation;measurement points;DS corresponds;dynamic situation;transmitter;Doppler frequency shift;numerical transformation;presented transformation;normalized DS shape;measured modeled PAS;power azimuth spectrum;normalized Doppler spectrum;signal reception angle;received signal dispersion;frequency domain;estimation methods;modeling methods;channel characteristics","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coherent Beam Combining is an alternative approach to the construction of high-power lasers, which mitigates the thermo-optic problems occurring in the classic laser construction [1]. However, phased array requires the control of a larger number of parameters, which results in easier beam quality degradation. The most important are phase mismatch (piston error) and tilt error, which cause energy spreading into the side lobes and distortion of the main lobe in far-field intensity pattern. To achieve effective combining, piston and tilt error must be controlled with accuracy to fraction of wavelength [2]. We present numerical model of coherent beam combining of 2D array of laser beams. The analysis of beam combining quality for hexagonal array with seven elements (Fig. 1 a -b) in dependence on Super -Gaussian SGp beam profile for tilt and piston error have been presented. We have taken the tolerance limit as a decrease in Strehl ratio (SR) by 20% for piston and tilt error. Additionally for tilt error as tolerance limit we have taken pointing RMS error equal to diffraction limit 1 Af/D.","","978-1-7281-0469-0","10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8871633","","Laser beams;Structural beams;Pistons;Phased arrays;Laser noise;Degradation;Tolerance analysis","error analysis;Gaussian distribution;laser arrays;laser beams;light coherence;light diffraction;pistons;tolerance analysis","RMS error;Strehl ratio;super-Gaussian beam profile;piston error;phase mismatch;beam quality degradation;classic laser construction;thermo-optic problems;high-power lasers;coherent beam combining;hexagonal laser phased array;tilt error;tolerance analysis","","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of modeling the angular scattering of radio waves under multipath propagation conditions, various types of dedicated geometric or empirical models of the probability density function of angle of arrival (PDF of AOA) are used. The first group of these models is so-called theoretical models that allow you to determine the geometric location and the density of scattering with respect to the receiver. In the second group, standard distributions (PDF), such as the Gaussian, Laplacian or von Mises distribution, are used for statistical description of scattering. In this paper, a comparison of selected empirical and geometric PDF models in the azimuth plane is presented. In comparative analysis, selected empirical scenarios are used. Based on them, the approximation of PDF models is made. Then, the least square error and AS are compared. The obtained results show that the Laplacian provides the best approximation of the empirical PDF of AOA.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293449","","Analytical models;Probability density function;Scattering;Laplace equations;Azimuth;Dispersion;Adaptation models","direction-of-arrival estimation;electromagnetic wave scattering;least squares approximations;radiowave propagation;statistical distributions","multipath propagation conditions;dedicated geometric models;empirical models;theoretical models;geometric location;von Mises distribution;selected empirical scenarios;multipath propagation conditionsv;power azimuth spectrum;PAS;angular dispersion;received signals;rms angle spread;scalar measure;radio wave geometric modeling angular scattering;angle of arrival;geometric PDF model approximation;empirical PDF models","","","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, strengthening the selection pressure of population toward the Pareto-optimal front becomes more challenging, since the proportion of nondominated solutions in the population scales up sharply with the increase of the number of objectives. To address these issues, this paper first defines the nondominated solutions exhibiting evident tendencies toward the Pareto-optimal front as prominent solutions, using the hyperplane formed by their neighboring solutions, to further distinguish among nondominated solutions. Then, a novel environmental selection strategy is proposed with two criteria in mind: 1) if the number of nondominated solutions is larger than the population size, all the prominent solutions are first identified to strengthen the selection pressure. Subsequently, a part of the other nondominated solutions are selected to balance convergence and diversity and 2) otherwise, all the nondominated solutions are selected; then a part of the dominated solutions are selected according to the predefined reference vectors. Moreover, based on the definition of prominent solutions and the new selection strategy, we propose a hyperplane assisted evolutionary algorithm, referred here as hpaEA, for solving MaOPs. To demonstrate the performance of hpaEA, extensive experiments are conducted to compare it with five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on 36 many-objective benchmark instances. The experimental results show the superiority of hpaEA which significantly outperforms the compared algorithms on 20 out of 36 benchmark instances.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2899225","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province; National Defense Technology Innovation Special Zone Projects; National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657996","Continuous optimization;evolutionary computations;hyperplane;many-objective optimization;selection pressure","Convergence;Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Cybernetics;Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We aim to minimize the energy usage of user devices while streaming video, as well as to create extended sleep opportunities, while simultaneously preventing buffer underflows. We also develop an online algorithm to obtain an efficient solution robust to prediction errors. Our results show that using a variable DRX cycle length can reduce the energy usage by up to 60 percent and 40 percent, in the offline and online cases, respectively, compared with a static DRX configuration. Our proposed online algorithm can also reduce the number of buffer underflows by up to 97 percent compared to the offline case.

Our BOR FDTD retains the advantages of general-purpose 3D FDTD software, providing full-wave solutions and delivering key engineering parameters of antenna systems together with an insight into the distribution of the electromagnetic near-field, a useful feature to assess the mismatch of the horn due to the subreflector interaction.

Various RFL based amplifier designs have been evaluated in long-haul coherent transmission systems. The results shows the Fabry-Perot fibre laser based amplifier with two fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) gives significant Q factor penalty using symmetrical bidirectional pumping, as the RIN of the signal is increased dramatically. However, random distributed feedback fibre laser based amplifier with a single FBG near the output section can mitigate the RIN of the signal, which enables the use of bidirectional second order pumping and therefore gives the best transmission performance up to 7915 km. Furthermore, using random DFB fibre laser based amplifier has been proven to be effective to combat nonlinear impairment.

The idea of the explorer UAV emerged from the need to draw a sketch of the rooms before a man entered, no matter the interior is a newly discovered cave or building. Thus, the system for point cloud data acquisition has been designed for feeding simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm. The developed system is based on an infrared depth sensor that returns data as a range image. The sensor is rotated at a constant speed so that the measurements are performed at predefined angles, which results with the data about distances to objects in a hemisphere around the position of the sensor. The system was tested in static and dynamic laboratory conditions. Static tests include measurements of the distance to the fixed obstacles made around a sensor placed on the fixed platform. In dynamic tests, the platform with the sensor and the obstacle is also linearly moved relative to each other. The laboratory stand was designed, where the platform on the trolley was moved along the linear trail with controlled speed. Results obtained from those tests reassure its suitability as a basis for the future development of the collision avoidance system and three-dimensional modeling sensor.","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2019.2918043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8861455","","Sensor systems;Collision avoidance;Brushless motors;Navigation;Cameras;Simultaneous localization and mapping","aerospace instrumentation;aircraft control;angular velocity control;autonomous aerial vehicles;collision avoidance;data acquisition;distance measurement;infrared detectors;mobile robots;SLAM (robots)","three-dimensional modeling sensor;obstacles detection technique;hemispherical area;underground explorer UAV;point cloud data acquisition;infrared depth sensor;collision avoidance system;unmanned aerial vehicle;simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm;laboratory conditions;speed control","","","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Post-mortem iris recognition, despite being a potentially useful method that could aid forensic identification, can also pose challenges when used inappropriately, i.e. utilizing a dead organ of a person in an unauthorized way. Our approach is based on the VGG-16 architecture fine-tuned with a database of 574 post-mortem, near-infrared iris images from the WarsawBioBase-PostMortem-Iris-v1 database, complemented by a dataset of 256 images of live irises, collected within the scope of this study. Experiments described in this paper show that our approach is able to correctly classify iris images as either representing a live or a dead eye in almost 99% of the trials, averaged over 20 subject-disjoint, train/test splits. We also show that the post-mortem iris detection accuracy increases as time since death elapses, and that we are able to construct a classification system with APCER=0%@BPCER≈1% (Attack Presentation and Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rates, respectively) when only post-mortem samples collected at least 16 hours post-mortem are considered. Since acquisitions of ante- and post-mortem samples differ significantly, we applied countermeasures to minimize bias in our classification methodology caused by image properties that are not related to the PAD. This included using the same iris sensor in collection of ante- and post-mortem samples, and analysis of class activation maps to ensure that discriminant iris regions utilized by our classifier are related to properties of the eye, and not to those of the acquisition protocol. This paper offers the first known to us PAD method in a postmortem setting, together with an explanation of the decisions made by the convolutional neural network. Along with the paper we offer source codes, weights of the trained network, and a dataset of live iris images to facilitate reproducibility and further research.","2474-9699","978-1-5386-7180-1","10.1109/BTAS.2018.8698542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698542","","Iris recognition;Iris;Training;Cadaver;Data models;Protocols;Convolutional neural networks","biometrics (access control);convolutional neural nets;image classification;iris recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);source code (software);visual databases","cadaver Iris;iris presentation attack detection;post-mortem iris recognition;VGG-16 architecture fine-tuned;574 post-mortem;WarsawBioBase-PostMortem-Iris-v1 database;Attack Presentation;Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rates;image properties;iris sensor;discriminant iris regions;PAD method;post-mortem iris detection accuracy;convolutional neural network;acquisition protocol;deep-learning-based method;source codes","","1","38","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally we used differences of these features with respect to archetype decks. Finally we used XGBoost to build a model predicting outcome of a game played between two decks.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511219","","Games;Training;Predictive models;Clustering algorithms;Electronic mail;Data mining;Mathematical model","computer games;data mining;pattern clustering","test decks;DBSCAN algorithm;precomputed distance matrix;archetype deck;cards quality;AAIA18 Data Mining Challenge;winrate prediction;Hearthstone deck archetypes;test decks clustering","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, characteristics of face cell receptive fields are poorly understood. In this theoretical study, we explore the effects of complexity, defined as algorithmic information (Kolmogorov complexity) and logical depth, on possible ways that face cells may be organized. We use tensor decompositions to decompose faces into a set of components, called tensorfaces, and their associated weights, which can be interpreted as model face cells and their firing rates. These tensorfaces form a high-dimensional representation space in which each tensorface forms an axis of the space. A distinctive feature of the decomposition algorithm is the ability to specify tensorface complexity. We found that low-complexity tensorfaces have blob-like appearances crudely approximating faces, while high-complexity tensorfaces appear clearly face-like. Low-complexity tensorfaces require a larger population to reach a criterion face reconstruction error than medium- or high-complexity tensorfaces, and thus are inefficient by that criterion. Low-complexity tensorfaces, however, generalize better when representing statistically novel faces, which are faces falling beyond the distribution of face description parameters found in the tensorface training set. The degree to which face representations are parts based or global forms a continuum as a function of tensorface complexity, with low and medium tensorfaces being more parts based. Given the computational load imposed in creating high-complexity face cells (in the form of algorithmic information and logical depth) and in the absence of a compelling advantage to using high-complexity cells, we suggest face representations consist of a mixture of low- and medium-complexity face cells.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco_a_01258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970473","","","","","","","","Traditional","","","","MITP",""

For the extraction of the permittivity and the loss tangent, three different ink particles were developed and printed on the top of interdigital-shaped microwave capacitor.

The data for each subject was acquired in three different sessions, with two first sessions organized on the same day, and the third session organized approximately two weeks apart. This allowed to analyze the stability of hand temperature in both short-term and long-term horizons. No hand stabilization or positioning devices were used during acquisition, making this setup closer to real-world, unconstrained applications. This required making our method translation-, rotation- and scale-invariant. Two approaches for feature selection and classification are proposed and compared: feature engineering deploying texture descriptors such as Binarized Statistical Image Features (BSIF) and Gabor wavelets, and feature learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained in different environmental conditions. For within-session scenario we achieved 0.36% and 0.00% of equal error rate (EER) in the first and the second approach, respectively. Between-session EER stands at 27.98% for the first approach and 17.17% for the second one. These results allow for estimation of a short-term stability of hand thermal information.

We demonstrate that previous detections and non-detections of this line are consistent with a dark matter interpretation. For example, in our simulations the width of the dark matter decay line for Perseus-analogue galaxy clusters lies in the range of 1300–1700 ${\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ , and exceptionally up to 3000 ${\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ . Therefore, the non-detection of the 3.55 keV line in the centre of the Perseus cluster by the Hitomi collaboration is consistent with detections by other instruments. We also consider trends with stellar and halo mass and evaluate the scatter in the expected fluxes arising from the anisotropic halo mass distribution and from object-to-object variations. We provide specific predictions for observations with XMM–Newton and with the planned X-ray telescopes XRISM and ATHENA. If future detections of unexplained X-ray lines match our predictions, including line widths, we will have strong evidence that we have discovered the dark matter.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stz691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688938","(galaxies:) Local Group;(cosmology:) dark matter","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In both demonstrators, the radio nodes are equipped with some cognitive functions, but the main effort was concerned to present DSM possibilities to use on the tactical and battlefield MANETs. The experiments show significant increase of spectrum efficiency and jamming resistance for both DSM solutions. CDSA concept is ready to introduce in military networks based on legacy radios, assuming that they have an ability to implement OTAR procedures.

In such networks, the inter-core crosstalk (XT) effect in MCFs impairs the quality of transmission (QoT) of optical signals, which has a negative impact on overall network performance. In this context, a key issue is the selection of a modulation format (MF) for a particular lightpath, since each MF offers a different tradeoff between spectral efficiency (number of occupied frequency slices) and transmission reach, and both these elements are in a close relation with the experienced XT. In fact, it is difficult to quantify the impact of the MFs used in a given network on the deterioration in QoT due to the XT effect and on overall network performance, as the levels of XT experienced by particular lightpaths depend directly on the ongoing transmissions in neighbor MCF cores, and those (i.e., established lightpaths) are subject to stochastic changes in dynamic SS-FONs. Therefore, in this article, we propose an approach that selects a MF for a lightpath based only on the transmission distance, i.e., length of the applied routing path. In particular, for each considered MF, we define a Modulation format Distance Limit (MDL) parameter that is used to select the MF for a lightpath by a simple comparison of the considered routing path length against the MDL parameter. To facilitate the very complex process of determining the best values of the MDL parameter, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach, namely, supervised learning regression method, with the overall goal to optimize network performance in terms of bandwidth blocking probability (BBP). Extensive simulation experiments performed in different network scenarios show that the proposed method ML allows to achieve performance gains when compared to various reference approaches, including a more computationally expensive method that is based on dynamic (flexible) selection of MFs.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2020.2967087","National Science Centre, Poland; National Science Centre, Poland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961142","Space division multiplexing;multi-core fiber;quality of transmission;routing;spatial mode and spectrum allocation;network optimization;pattern recognition","Optical fiber networks;Optimization;Routing;Estimation;Modulation;Crosstalk;Resource management","","","","","27","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our radio systems are the mainly a source of interferences during the mission but the radio system must be ready to deal with an electronic warfare - with the intentional jamming. A solution can be the Cognitive Radio (CR), that has some autonomy to make decisions about the spectrum usage, that can be useful to ensure information exchange in the presence of intentional and accidental interferences. Efficient spectrum use is based on electromagnetic situation awareness, that can be obtained by spectrum sensing. We evaluate various sensing polices to optimize CR work against fast types of jammers. The operational assessment of different types of missions realization efficiency by service utility function is difficult and not always unequivocally shows changes introduced by a new policy implementation.

Repeated polymer deposition reduces the size of uncovered pore walls regions and thus leads to a strengthening of negative optical anisotropy observed in the experiments.","","978-1-5386-5333-3","10.1109/NAP.2018.8915272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8915272","nanocomposites;liquid crystals;modulation polarimetry;nanocofinement","Geometrical optics;Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Optical polymers;Optical films;Optical saturation;Nanocomposites","alumina;birefringence;liquid crystal polymers;membranes;nanostructured materials;nematic liquid crystals;polymer films","optical birefringence;polymer pore-surface grafting;nematic liquid crystal 5FPFFPP3;optical anisotropy;polymer deposition;inhomogeneous coverage;organic solution;chemical film deposition;SE-1211 polymer film;alumina membranes;parallel cylindrical channels;optical polarimetry;tubular nanopores;molecular ordering;Al2O3","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data gathered during these missions helped to evaluate the basic concept of an airborne vertical electric aerial for Very Low Frequency range; it showed that very long aerials may induce electric charge flow when passing through the cloud layer, need additional weight at their ends to assure safe descent and, when composed of a tape-like structure, automatically move in a helical way, which, with a sufficient antenna length, may in the future enable the design of an elliptically-polarized vertical VLF antenna.

This leads to increased difficulty in modelling and mitigating partial link failures, such as those caused by unfavourable weather.

The influence of slow-light grating parameters, such as grating length (L), index change (δn), and loss coefficient (α), on the spectral and on the sensing characteristics of π-FBG are studied in detail. The simulation results show that for the maximum slow-light sensitivity the optimum grating parameters are obtained as L = 5 mm, δn = 1×10-3 and α = 0.10 m-1.

Application of this method allows for reducing distorting influence of a modern rolling stock supplied by a 3 kV dc catenary on the railway signaling, command, and control systems. The efficiency of the proposed method is independent of synchronization of a vehicle's inverters and of load balance of traction motors, which makes it more reliable than as it is proposed in the literature. Results of computer simulations were presented and compared with laboratory measurements. The obtained dc-link current spectrum using the proposed SHE/SHM method was compared with spectra received using synchronized and unsynchronized sinusoidal pulse-width modulations (SPWMs). Based on the conducted tests, it was shown that the proposed method of control, which was implemented in a laboratory drive system, is effective in reducing dc side current harmonics in a frequency range of 1300-3100 Hz, which is used by track circuits on railway lines, e.g., in Poland.

Our polymer foil is composed of PI-2611 and contains embedded gold/platinum/chromium traces. Contact pads are platinum coated and no under bump metallization is required. Instead of using wire bonding techniques, the contact pads are flip-chip bonded directly onto the PCB using a lead free solder paste. Transfer of the foil is carried out by vacuum placement. Soldering is subsequently performed in a vapor phase soldering oven. In contrast to wire bonding on flexible substrate materials, vapor phase soldering results in enhanced contact yield of approximately 99%. The landing area of the thin-film electrode, containing the soldered contact pads, is then passivated with a low-shrinkage epoxy in a pin-transfer process. Using such a low-shrinkage material is paramount to achieve sufficient long-term stability of the solder connections and to stabilize the thin polyimide substrate.","","978-0-9568086-4-6","10.23919/EMPC.2017.8346897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8346897","polyimide;foil;flip-chip;packaging;bonding;FR4","Electrodes;Soldering;Metallization;Packaging;Polyimides;Bonding","biomedical electrodes;bonding processes;flip-chip devices;gold;integrated circuit bonding;integrated circuit packaging;platinum;polymers;printed circuits;shrinkage;soldering;solders;substrates","flexible substrate materials;enhanced contact yield;soldered contact pads;low-shrinkage epoxy;pin-transfer process;low-shrinkage material;solder connections;polyimide substrate;polyimide foil flip-chip direct bonding;cost-effective advanced bonding techniques;multielectrode arrays;common packaging technologies;cost-effective direct bonding process;polyimide thin-film electrode arrays;polymer foil;lead free solder paste;vapor phase soldering oven;vapor phase soldering;polymer substrates;gold traces;neuroprosthetics;platinum traces;chromium traces;PCB","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods: Computer recordings of directly-measured ICP, ABP, and transcranial Doppler cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), from 37 NPH patients undergoing infusion tests, were retrospectively analyzed. The CrCP was calculated with three methods: one with the first harmonics ratio of the pulse waveforms of ABP and CBFV (CrCPA) and two methods based on a model of cerebrovascular impedance, as functions of both cerebral perfusion pressure (CrCPinv), and of ABP (CrCPninv). Conclusion: All methods give similar results in response to ICP changes. In the case of individual CrCP measurements for each patient, CrCPA may provide negative, nonphysiological values.

In particular, the current push toward fog computing, in which control, computation, and storage are moved to nodes close to the network edge, induces a need to collect data at multiple sinks, rather than the single sink typically considered in WSN aggregation algorithms. Moreover, for machine-to-machine communication scenarios, actuators subscribing to sensor measurements may also be present, in which case data should be not only aggregated and processed in-network but also disseminated to actuator nodes. In this paper, we present mixed-integer programming formulations and algorithms for the problem of energy-optimal routing and multiple-sink aggregation, as well as joint aggregation and dissemination, of sensor measurement data in IoT edge networks. We consider optimization of the network for both minimal total energy usage, and min-max per-node energy usage. We also provide a formulation and algorithm for throughput-optimal scheduling of transmissions under the physical interference model in the pure aggregation case. We have conducted a numerical study to compare the energy required for the two use cases, as well as the time to solve them, in generated network scenarios with varying topologies and between 10 and 40 nodes. Although aggregation only accounts for less than 15% of total energy usage in all cases tested, it provides substantial energy savings.

Consequently, secure techniques for data transmissions will be needed as the basis for 5G-IoT technology to address these arising challenges. Therefore, various traditional security mechanisms are provided for 5G-IoT technologies and most of them are built on mathematical foundations. With the growth of quantum technologies, traditional cryptographic techniques may be compromised due to their mathematical computation based construction. Quantum walks (QWs) is a universal quantum computational model, which possesses inherent cryptographic features that can be utilized to build efficient cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper, we use the features of quantum walk to construct a new S-box method which plays a significant role in block cipher techniques for 5G-IoT technologies. As an application of the presented S-box mechanism and controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQWs) for 5G-IoT technologies a new robust video encryption mechanism is proposed. As well as to fulfill needs of encryption for varied files in 5G-IoT, we utilize the features of quantum walk to propose a novel encryption strategy for secure transmission of sensitive files in 5G-IoT paradigm.

The localization of machines, sensors and workers inside the industrial premises is one of such interfaces used by many applications. Current localization-based systems are unable to deal with highly variable conditions, meaning that the solutions working well in stationary systems suffer from considerable difficulties in harsh environments, such as factories. As a result, the precision of localization techniques is not satisfactory in most industrial applications. This paper fills in the existing gap between static approaches and dynamic indoor positioning systems, by presenting a solution adapting the system to highly changeable conditions. The proposed solution makes use of a Machine Learning-based feedback loop that learns the variability of the environment. This feedback makes continuous fingerprint calibration feasible even in the presence of different machines and Industrial Internet of Things sensors that introduce variations to the electromagnetic environment. This paper also presents a comprehensive indoor positioning system solution that reduces complexity of hardware, meaning that a multi-standard-transceiver infrastructure may be adopted with reduced capital and operational expenditures. We have developed the system from scratch and have conducted an extensive range of testbed experiments showing that the multi-technology transceiver feature is capable of increasing positioning accuracy, as well as of introducing permanent fingerprints calibration at harsh industrial premises.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.2980800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036862","Positioning system;Mahalanobis distance;calibration;industrial IoT;industrial interface","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this regard, this paper focuses on one of the next generation services so-called follow me service (FMS). FMS is a service offered by 5gNB to user equipments (UEs) in indoor environments (e.g., home), it enables its clients to use their smart phones to select media content from content servers, then cast it on the nearest TV set (e.g., living room) and continue watching on the next TV set (e.g., kitchen) while moving around the indoor coverage area. FMS can be provisioned by utilizing UEs geolocation information and robust mechanisms for switching between multiple 5G radio access technologies (RATs), based on the intelligence of the SDN/NFV intelligent home IP gateway of the Internet of Radio Light (IoRL) project paradigm. In view that the actual IoRL system is at its early development stage, we step forward by using Mininet platform to integrate SDN/NFV virtualization into 5G multi-RAT scenario and provide performance monitoring with measurements for the identified service. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposal under various use case scenarios by means of minimizing the packet loss rate and improving QoE of the home users.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2019.2898159","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8649813","Software defined networks;network function virtualisation;quality of experience;Internet of radio light;intelligent home IP gateway","Servers;Frequency modulation;Smart TV;Smart phones;5G mobile communication;Quality of experience","5G mobile communication;computer network management;digital television;home networks;Internet;IP networks;quality of experience;radio access networks;software defined networking;virtualisation","packet loss rate;smart television services;software-defined networks;digital televisions;smart TV services;smart phones;content servers;QoE;Mininet platform;IoRL system;Internet of Radio Light project;intelligent home IP gateway;follow me service;next generation services;quality of experience;network function virtualization;NFV-SDN network management;5G radio access technologies","","4","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome this obstacle, a simple pre-diagnostic procedure, using hand-held smartphones is proposed. Different faults of the three-phase squirrel cage induction machine such as various numbers of broken rotor bars and dynamic rotor eccentricity are inflicted to the machine and the resulting audible signals are recorded in laboratory circumstances using two widely available commercial smartphones. The analysis is performed on audible noise and compared with the results of mechanical vibrations measurements, recorded by vibration sensors. Rotational speed frequency and twice-line frequency are used as diagnostic indicators of faults. A simple neural network is composed and probabilities of fault detection using such diagnostic measures are presented.

Furthermore, data collected from sensors should be processed and analyzed nearly in real time. The classical algorithms have two main drawbacks: they deal with unidimensional data and they fail to assume limited information available in stream data processing. In this paper, new solutions are discussed and presented that detect anomalies in data streams nearly in real time. Specifically, we propose (1) an event detection method used in unidimensional data streams and relying on the Event Strength Function, which is an extension of the typical ""True or False"" decision-making scheme, (2) multiple-criteria event detection approaches based on the Dynamic Pareto Set, introducing a time-depending decision set, and (3) an anomaly detection method based on multicriteria temporal graphs, combining the dynamics of decision-making and multicriteria.

However, these methods are faced with several obvious limitations. Most of these models are extremely time consuming when learning the large-scale FCMs with hundreds of nodes. Furthermore, the FCMs learned by those algorithms lack robustness when the experimental data contain noise. In addition, reasonable distribution of the weights is rarely considered in these algorithms, which could result in the reduction of the performance of the resulting FCM. In this article, a straightforward, rapid, and robust learning method is proposed to learn FCMs from noisy data, especially, to learn large-scale FCMs. The crux of the proposed algorithm is to equivalently transform the learning problem of FCMs to a classic-constrained convex optimization problem in which the least-squares term ensures the robustness of the well-learned FCM and the maximum entropy term regularizes the distribution of the weights of the well-learned FCM. A series of experiments covering two frequently used activation functions (the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions) are performed on both synthetic datasets with noise and real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method is rapid and robust against data containing noise and that the well-learned weights have better distribution. In addition, the FCMs learned by the proposed method also exhibit superior performance in comparison with the existing methods.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2019.2933438","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Canada Research Chairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809095","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);maximum entropy;noisy data;rapid and robust learning","Learning systems;Noise measurement;Entropy;Robustness;Convex functions;Linear programming;Fuzzy cognitive maps","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The most effective technique of band diagram characterization is the photoelectric measurement based on internal photoemission phenomena in the layered structures. In the technologically important metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures, the most important parameters of the band diagram are barrier heights on both sides of the insulator layer. In this article, we consider graphene-insulator-semiconductor (GIS) structures in which the graphene replaces metal as the gate material. Using graphene layer as the gate of the structure facilitates direct measurements of the photocurrent due to hole emission from the substrate into the insulator, allowing determination of the barrier height for holes. Having also measured the barrier height for electrons emitted from the substrate into the insulator the direct determination of the insulator band gap is possible.","2158-1029","978-1-5090-3615-8","10.1109/ICMTS.2017.7954260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954260","","Semiconductor device measurement;Substrates;Logic gates;Insulators;Graphene;Photoconductivity;Absorption","electric current measurement;graphene;MIS structures;photoemission;semiconductor devices","insulator band gap;electron barrier height;hole emission;photocurrent measurements;graphene layer;MIS structures;metal-insulator-semiconductor structures;layered structures;internal photoemission;photoelectric measurement;band diagram characterization;physical parameters;energy band diagram;semiconductor devices band diagram;photoelectric determination;GIS structures;graphene-insulator-semiconductor structures","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A base, simple model adopts a classical log-kill hypothesis for chemotherapy and a linear-quadratic response for radiotherapy. The model is represented by the first order nonlinear differential equations with two control variables which can be transformed into a linear differential equations with a nonlinear control action. The multi-input optimal control problem formulated for this model is solved explicitly. It is shown that optimal treatment should apply radiotherapy first, while the onset of chemotherapy should be delayed. The second model takes into account the effects of drug metabolism (pharmacokinetics) and DNA repair of adjacent strand breaks. By obtaining full analytical results for chemotherapy control and partial results for radiotherapy it is shown that an introduction of these additional processes alters the structure of optimal control, which sometimes leads to opposite conclusions. A numerical example is provided which suggests that in practice the differences may not be as critical as the purely theoretical results would suggest.","","978-1-5386-4325-9","10.1109/MMAR.2018.8485901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485901","","Mathematical model;Optimal control;Chemotherapy;Tumors;DNA;Maintenance engineering","biochemistry;DNA;drugs;nonlinear differential equations;physiological models;radiation therapy","first-order nonlinear differential equations;linear-quadratic response;classical log-kill hypothesis;radio-chemotherapy;chemotherapy control;DNA repair;pharmacokinetics;drug metabolism;radiotherapy;nonlinear control action;linear differential equations","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each of the underground RF stations consists of a multibeam horizontal klystron that can provide up to 10 MW of power at 1.3 GHz. Klystrons are sensitive devices with a limited lifetime and a high mean time between failures. In real operation, the lifetime of the tube can be significantly reduced because of failures. The special fast protection klystron lifetime management (KLM) system has been developed to minimize the influence of service conditions on the lifetime of klystrons. The main task of this system is to detect all events which can destroy the tube as quickly as possible, and switch off the driving RF signal or the high voltage. Detection of events is based on a comparison of the value of the real signal obtained at the system output with the value estimated on the basis of a high-power RF amplifier model and input signals. The KLM system has been realized in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and implemented in XFEL. Implementation is based on the standard low-level RF micro telecommunications computing architecture (MTCA.4 or xTCA). The main part of the paper focuses on an estimation of the klystron model and the implementation of KLM in FPGA.

To address this demand, 110-kV power networks are regularly expanded inside and around cities in Poland. These power networks are often constructed as underground cable lines. The 110-kV cable lines are usually designed as three single-core cables laid in a common route. In case of long 110-kV cable lines, the cross-bonding method is applied to the connection of metal sheaths of these cables. Additionally, one or more earth continuity conductors are laid along the main cable line and earthed at both their ends. These earth continuity conductors can be uninsulated and can cause electric shock hazard (danger step voltages). The problem defined in this paper consists of an attempt to calculate the expected step voltages for different considered earth continuity conductor arrangements in 110-kV cable lines and to compare the obtained results to admissible values of the voltages found in an appropriate standard. Protection against electric shock, calculation of earthing resistance, and step voltages, as well as simulation studies in case of sample 110-kV cable lines have been described in the paper. The results show the analyzed layouts of 110-kV cable lines have significant impact on the values of voltages occurring in and around earth continuity conductors. The maximum values of earth electrode voltage (and in this way expected touch voltages), as well as step voltages occur in the layout of single cable line and single earth continuity conductor arranged in parallel.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2019.2916890","RWE; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715671","Power cable lines;earth continuity conductors electric shock protection;step voltage","Power cables;Grounding;Cable shielding;Earth;Conductors;Electric shock;Electrodes","","","","","28","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents several benchmarks of ATN systems and their characteristics being the subject of research. We show that general measures are rarely used to assess network size, its regularity, demand structure, and traffic parameters. We also show that scalar variables are not used for comparison, which makes them doubtful. We propose a set of measures for several of the most important features of ATN systems.

The proposed method is performed by removing the less important switches of an RA. Therefore, the RA only has a few important switches that have strong influences on the reconfigurability. The importance of a switch is evaluated by the minimum percentage of useful configurations (PUC). A monopole-type omni-directional frequency RA with 85 uniformly-distributed switches is optimized in this paper. For this type of antennas, a reflection coefficient less than -20 dB and a gain greater than 0 dBi at the same frequency makes a useful configuration. After reducing the switch number from 85 to 15, the complexity of the RA is greatly decreased while the reconfigurability is increased by more than 100 times within the band of 2 to 7 GHz. With only 15 optimally deployed switches, the PUC is significantly increased. Therefore, it is easy to find out the states of the switches to let the frequency RA work well at different frequencies. The results show that the proposed method is an efficient way to design RAs with switches in an optimal deployment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2812139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8306863","Importance of switch;internal multi-port method (IMPM);percentage of useful configurations (PUC);reconfigurability;reconfigurable antenna (RA);switch deployment","Antenna radiation patterns;Feeds;Complexity theory;Impedance;Optimization;Reflection coefficient","antenna radiation patterns;microwave antennas;monopole antennas;UHF antennas","massive switches;monopole-type omni-directional frequency RA;switch number;frequency RA work;frequency reconfigurable antennas;optimally deployed switches;minimum percentage of useful configuration;frequency 2.0 GHz to 7.0 GHz","","2","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The physiological evidence suggests that the biarticular muscles can reduce the negative power production in the actuators and therefore contribute to the efficiency of the explosive movements. We perform the jump movement on the compliant robotic leg (CARL) to verify the role of biarticular elements in a physical platform. We further investigate how the actuator force distribution method can contribute to the economics of the explosive task. In our experiments, the biarticular actuators display similar behavior to their biological counterparts, with respect to energy transfer. A comparison study of two force distribution methods shows that the minimization of the instant power can improve the efficiency of the movements by up to 5%.

This method is based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method that allows to reduce the dimensionality of the problem of image recognition. The paper presents a method of maritime objects recognition based on FLIR images consisting of the following stages: pre-processing of images from the pattern database, calculation of coordinates of images from the pattern database in a new reduced feature space, calculation of coordinates of image cluster centers, pre-processing of a new image, calculation of coordinates of a new image in the reduced feature space, calculation of the distances of the recognized image from all the image cluster centers in the pattern database and making a decision on choosing the most similar maritime object, or stating that there is no image satisfying the similarity condition in the pattern database. The combination of the principal component analysis (PCA) method with the method of eigenimages analysis reduces the dimensionality of the recognition problem. The original dimension is equal to the number of pixels in each image. It must be equal for all the images from pattern database and the image being recognized. The final value of the problem dimension is equal to the number of image clusters in the pattern database. In some situations, the dimensionality of the problem can be reduced due to the low eigenvalues of the matrix of Karhunen-Loeve transformation.

However, the performance of digital relays depends on many factors and needs to be carefully evaluated. These factors may be caused correct operations with less performance or completely incorrect operations. Frequency deviation is one of those factors which results from unbalanced demand load and generation levels. Load characteristics and generation control response to demand load changes will effect on amount and duration of frequency deviations. Frequency decreases when demand load is higher than generation, whereas, it increases when load is less than generation. Protection relays are provided with frequency tracking to reduce the effects of frequency deviations on accuracy of relays decisions. In this paper traditional frequency tracking technique used on protection relays is modified to give a better performance during off-nominal frequency variations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with traditional tracking using Least Square Error (LSQ), and Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm without any tracking, which are investigated in MATLAB environment.","","978-1-5090-5795-5","10.1109/INISTA.2017.8001159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001159","Numerical Relays;Frequency Deviation;Phasor Estimation;Digital Signal Processing","Frequency estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Relays;Estimation;Signal processing algorithms;Power harmonic filters;Mathematical model","adaptive estimation;relay protection","off-nominal frequency variations;frequency tracking;digital multifunction protection relays;adaptive phasor estimation technique","","1","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lack of the waveguiding core increases the oscillator strength of the VCSEL mode, allows the ultimate optical confinement (“λ/2 design”) and reduces dramatically the optical power accumulated in the VCSEL mesa in the regions outside of the oxide aperture. We consider basic differences of conventional and antiwaveguiding VCSEL and address optical modes in the device. Both Joule heat and heat generated by the free carrier absorption of the optical mode in the doped semiconductor layers and their impact on the refractive index profile are considered. We show that for typical regimes of the VCSEL design and operation absorption-induced heat exceeds by several times the Joule heat while the shape of the generated heated domains strongly differ. Modeling shows that current increase results in an increase in spectral separation of the fundamental and high-order transverse optical modes. Selection of the fundamental mode persists upon increase in injection current up to 10 mA at 5 μm aperture diameter.

Degradation of the photon information efficiency is studied in the case when the background count rate is at most comparable with the rate of photodetection events generated by the incoming optical signal. The PPM symbol length is optimized under the constraint of a fixed average spectral power density using an analytical approximation. The results are compared with generalized on-off keying (OOK) optimized over the a priori probability distribution for the input binary alphabet. The generalized OOK scheme can be viewed as a relaxation of the PPM scheme by removing the requirement that a light pulse must occur exactly once in each fixed-length frame of time bins that constitute the PPM symbol. It is shown that the asymptotic scaling of the photon information efficiency does not change qualitatively in this scenario.","","978-1-5090-6511-0","10.1109/ICSOS.2017.8357229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357229","","Photonics;Noise measurement;Optimization;Optical pulses;Detectors;Integrated optics;Mutual information","optical communication;probability;pulse position modulation","photon-starved regime;pulse position modulation format;photon information efficiency;background count rate;photodetection events;PPM symbol length;fixed average spectral power density;a priori probability distribution;generalized OOK scheme;PPM scheme;fixed-length frame;noisy direct detection;optical communication","","1","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For comparison two LPGs, namely one before and after the nanocoating process were optimized towards working at dispersion turning point (DTP) of higher order cladding modes. The DTP was reached with two methods, i.e., by wet etching of LPG's cladding and by optimized deposition of Al2O3 thin overlay using atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. For both the cases we show significant increase in RI sensitivity at DTP. When Al2O3 is deposited the RI sensitivity reaches 9270 nm/RIU for traced only one resonance out of the pair and RI in range 1.33-1.34 RIU, what is over 4-fold higher than for the bare LPG. Moreover, T sensitivity for both the structures was compared and the one for Al2O3-coated sample was found to be only up to 12% higher than for the bare sample. Higher RI sensitivity and low temperature cross-sensitivity effects allow for more accurate RI measurements than in case of bare LPGs. The Al2O3-nanocoated LPGs can further find applications in label-free biosensing, due to their optimized sensitivity in RI in range close that of water.","","978-1-5090-4850-2","10.1117/12.2267635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961094","optical fiber sensor;long-period grating (LPG);dispersion turning point (DTP);thin film;aluminum oxide (Al2O3);atomic layer deposition (ALD);refractive index sensing;temperature sensing","Sensitivity;Aluminum oxide;Coatings;Temperature sensors;Refractive index;Gratings;Optical fiber sensors","aluminium compounds;antireflection coatings;atomic layer deposition;diffraction gratings;etching;fibre optic sensors;nanophotonics;optical fibre cladding;optical fibre dispersion;optical films;refractive index measurement","refractive index sensing;nanocoated long period gratings;dispersion turning point;temperature cross-sensitivity;LPG;refractive index sensitivity;nanocoating;DTP;higher order cladding modes;wet etching;atomic layer deposition;ALD;resonance;label-free biosensing;Al2O3","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, multiple important challenges need to be addressed in order to take the full advantage of these applications. One of the most important of these challenges concerns the management of IoT data, practically the data generated in dynamic and volatile environments and then provided in the form of streaming datasets. To enable reliable IoT applications in such scenario, it is crucial to develop methods that are able to automatically resolve any possible data conflict between diverse information sources in the case where the data is coming in a streaming fashion. In this paper, an incremental evidential conflict resolution method (I-ECRM) that is able to overcome this problem is introduced.

For this reason, modern propagation models should consider directional antennas with different beam widths, gains and radiation pattern directions. Most of the available propagation models are based on omnidirectional or isotropic antennas. A proposition to solve this problem is an empirical path loss model that considers the different types of antennas. This model assumes that the transmitting and receiving antenna beams are directing each other. In this paper, we propose modifying this model by determining attenuation for any direction of the antenna patterns. For this aim, the multi-elliptic channel model is used.","","978-1-78561-816-1","10.1049/cp.2018.0387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8568065","multipath propagation;channel modeling;path loss model;antenna pattern;gain;directional antenna;multi-elliptical channel model;non-line-of-sight conditions","","","","","2","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The basic idea is to transmit sequences of suitably modulated coherent light pulses whose energy can be concentrated in a single temporal bin on the receiver side through optical interference. Two examples of scalable architectures for structured receivers are presented. The first one, based on active polarization switching, maps Hadamard codewords composed from the binary phase shift keying (BPSK) constellation onto the standard pulse position modulation (PPM) format. The second receiver, using solely passive optical elements, converts phase-polarization patterns of coherent light pulses into a single pulse preserving a synchronized time of arrival. Such a conversion enables implementation of a communication protocol equivalent to the PPM scheme but with distributed optical power provided that the intersymbol guard-time exceeds the pattern length.","","978-1-5090-6511-0","10.1109/ICSOS.2017.8357208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357208","","Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Optical polarization;Optical pulses;Integrated optics;Optical modulation","Hadamard codes;light polarisation;optical receivers;phase shift keying;protocols;pulse position modulation;space communication links","peak-to-average power ratio;optical communication;optical interference;structured receivers;standard pulse position modulation format;communication protocol;distributed optical power;structured optical receivers;deep-space communication","","1","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data visualisation was performed by means of developing the relevant scripts. The objective was to obtain a visualisation result, that would be as similar as possible to an analogue topographic map of the M755 series. The automated visualisation was analysed by comparing each map symbol, developed in both tested GIS servers and juxtaposing it with the instruction for manual editing M755 series maps. The obtained maps are displayed in form of an interactive geoportal. The authors analysed the time of generating corresponding map fragments at various parameters (area size, number of requests processed simultaneously and the number of required layers). The results of the analysis demonstrate that the discussed GIS servers present the map symbols from the analogue map correctly in more than 90% of cases.

Many authors tried to estimate the potential benefits of such a solution. The main principle of the DBL system is to activate an exclusive bus lane (XBL) when a bus approaches a designated road segment and to deactivate XBL when the bus leaves the segment, making the lane available to all road users. The new solution requires additional infrastructure like variable message signs and in-pavement lights, informing drivers whether the DBL is active or not. One of the popular tools to evaluate the new solution is a traffic microsimulation model. Unfortunately, the available software has no ready tools for simulating the activation and deactivation process of the DBL. The paper proposes a new method for modelling DBL control in the PTV Vissim environment. Traffic simulation model was set up to analyze the DBL operation on a street in Rzeszow with an existing exclusive bus lane. The model was calibrated and validated based on travel time measurements along this section. Special control logic and network coding were used to simulate bus and car traffic when DBL is active. The study shows that DBL improves the average travel time for private transport while maintaining travel time savings for buses.","","978-1-5386-9484-8","10.1109/MTITS.2019.8883325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883325","dynamic bus lane;Intelligent Transport Systems;public transport;public transport priority;microsimulation traffic model;PTV Vissim","Roads;Analytical models;Traffic control;Time measurement;Vehicle dynamics;Tools;Volume measurement","control engineering computing;road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","dynamic bus lane;DBL system;XBL;road users;traffic microsimulation model;deactivation process;DBL control;traffic simulation model;DBL operation;car traffic;control logic;network coding;PTV Vissim environment","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In FT, end-to-end traffic demands are equipped with dedicated logical tunnels (for example MPLS tunnels) whose maximal capacity is subject to thinning in order to follow the fluctuations of the currently available link capacity. It follows that for each demand the instantaneous traffic realized between its end nodes must accommodate to the current total capacity available on its dedicated tunnels. In the paper we develop an optimization model for network dimensioning for a potentially implementable variant of FT, the so called General Affine Flow Thinning (GAFT), and present a solution algorithm based on the path generation approach.

Hence, directional antennas are frequently used to measure the level of the received signal. The path loss models obtained based on them are called directional path loss models, as opposed to omnidirectional path loss models.

The antenna that provides continuous connection between a satellite transmitter and receiver is one of the most important components of the GPS. Today's GPS is using two carrier frequencies, namely L1 = 1575 GHz, L2 = 1227 GHz. The GPS antennas used by the Europe-wide eCall system and the American On-Star service intended for quick automatic notification about road accidents interact with the antennas of mobile phones of the drivers who have had an accident and need immediate assistance. The system allows the driver both to deliver information and to request the car positioning at the same time. The article presents a designed, constructed and tested model of GPS antenna fabricated using microstrip technique. The mobile GPS antenna model has been designed using the microstrip technique as a printed antenna with a rectangular radiator with undercuts to provide rotating polarization. In order to design the antenna transmission line model and CST simulation environment based on FTDT methodology were used. A 1.5 mm thick technoService FR-4 laminate metal-plated on both sides with dielectric permittivity εr = 4.6 was used in the design. The laminate is coated with 0.07 mm thick copper layer, whereas the loss tangent amounts to 0.02. Using the computer simulation method the following was determined: directional characteristics, input impedance, standing wave ratio, scattering matrix ratio S11, as well as polarization ellipse. The paper also provides the results of laboratory measurements of antenna parameters carried out in the anechoic chamber. A comparative analysis of the GPS antenna parameters obtained by means of the computer simulation method and laboratory measurements is presented. The antenna described has the right-hand rotating polarization. Due to its small dimensions the antenna model is perfect for applications in the motor-car sector. In terms of dimensions the antenna perfectly fits into its designated place, i.e. the car windshield. The impact of windshield parameters was also taken into account during the antenna designing process. The antenna may also be integrated with the single in-line package with other car antennas.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293179","","Antenna radiation patterns;Antenna measurements;Microstrip antennas;Global Positioning System;Automobiles;Microstrip","anechoic chambers (electromagnetic);electromagnetic wave polarisation;Global Positioning System;laminates;microstrip antennas;permittivity;satellite antennas;UHF antennas","GPS antennas;Europe-wide eCall system;car positioning;microstrip technique;mobile GPS antenna model;printed antenna;antenna transmission line model;computer simulation method;GPS antenna parameters;satellite receiver;copper layer;American on-star service;road accident interact;technoService FR-4 laminate metal;CST simulation environment;FTDT methodology;single in-line package;satellite transmitter;satellite navigation services;location positioning;car microstrip GPS antenna;frequency 1575.0 GHz;frequency 1227.0 GHz;size 1.5 mm;size 0.07 mm","","4","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is able to replace the classical MV/LV transformer, where additional functionalities are necessary to provide the higher energy quality. Additionally, the ST is characterized by lower weight/volume and provides easy integration of AC and DC sub-grids. Therefore, in this paper, the modelling problem of a modern MV grid with classical and ST has beed described. Moreover, the comprehensive simulation analysis of the MV grid have been performed, where different functionalities of ST have been studied.

FSO is a well established wireless optical transmission technology considered as an alternative to radio communications for example in metropolitan wireless mesh networks. An FSO link is established by means of a laser beam between the transmitter and the receiver placed in the line of sight. A major disadvantage of FSO links (with respect to fiber links) is their sensitivity to weather conditions such as fog, rain and snow, causing substantial loss of the optical transmission power over the channel due mostly to absorption and scattering. Although the FSO technology allows for a fast and low-cost deployment of broadband networks, its operation will be affected by vulnerability of the link transmissions to weather conditions that can be manifested by substantial losses in links' transmission capacity with respect to the nominal capacity. Therefore, proper dimensioning of an FSO network should take such losses into account so that the level of carried traffic is satisfactory under all observed weather conditions. In the paper we introduce and study an optimization problem for such enhanced dimensioning using the robust optimization approach.","","978-1-5386-0671-1","10.1109/RNDM.2017.8093027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093027","","Meteorology;Robustness;Optimization;Optical transmitters;Modulation;Optical fiber communication;Uncertainty","broadband networks;free-space optical communication;optimisation","optical transmission power;FSO technology;broadband networks;link transmissions;observed weather conditions;robust FSO network dimensioning;Free Space Optics communications;metropolitan wireless mesh networks;FSO link;carried traffic;wireless optical transmission technology;optimization problem","","3","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A weight matrix describes relationships between concepts in a map. Concepts represent the underlying data, because they are extracted via a data-driven clustering procedure.

In this paper, the influence of the frequency co-channel beam directions of the antenna system on the powers ratio of the useful and the interference signal is presented. The changes of this ratio are shown both versus the radiation angle of signal as well as the width of the antenna system characteristics and the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. To map propagation phenomena in an urbanized environment, we used a multi-elliptical propagation model, whose geometrical structure is defined based on the radio channel impulse response. The use of this model in simulation studies allows the determination of angular power distributions of received signals. The fields of these characteristics are the basis for the evaluation of the power ratio of the useful signal and the co-channel interference. The presented methodology makes it possible to determine the angular separation between the directions of the co-channel beams.","","978-1-5386-9383-4","10.1109/ICMCIS.2019.8842698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842698","propagation;channel modeling;massive MIMO;multi-beam antenna;beamforming;multi-elliptical propagation model;co-channel interference;angular separation of transmission channels","Military communication;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;5G mobile communication;Radio links;Directive antennas","5G mobile communication;antenna arrays;cochannel interference;multibeam antennas;multipath channels;radio receivers;radio transmitters;radiowave propagation;transient response;wireless channels","transmission channels;frequency co-channel beam directions;powers ratio;interference signal;antenna system characteristics;map propagation phenomena;multielliptical propagation model;radio channel impulse response;angular power distributions;received signals;power ratio;co-channel interference;angular separation;co-channel beams;fifth generation systems;multibeam antenna systems;spatial separation;5G system multibeam antennas","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presently, these accelerator facilities are operated with pulsed RF. In the future, these facilities will operate with the continuous wave (CW), which requires significant modifications on the real-time feedbacks realized within the FPGA. For example, higher loaded quality factor of the superconducting RF cavities operated in the CW mode requires sophisticated resonance control methods. However, iterative learning techniques widely used for machines operated in pulsed mode are not applicable for the CW. In addition, the mechanical characteristic of the cavities now have a much more important impact on the choice of the feedback scheme. To overcome the limitations of classical proportional-integral controllers, a novel real-time adaptive feed-forward algorithm is implemented in the FPGA. Also, the high power RF amplifier, which is an inductive output tube (IOT) for CW operation instead of a klystron for the pulsed mode, has a major impact on the design and implementation of the firmware for regulation. In this paper, we report on our successful approach to control the multicavity vector sum with an ultrahigh precision (amplitude error <;0.01% rms and phase stability <;0.02° rms), using a single IOT source and the individual resonance control through piezoactuators.

Subsequently, the tested illuminators are an integral part of the sensor for measuring the stroke volume (SV) and the cardiac output (CO). Due to the operation principle of the computer video measurement method SV and CO developed by authors, the consistency of the obtained reconstruction of the flaccid membrane surface shape with the actual (reference) shape of the membrane is fundamentally important. For this reason, the influence of the developed lighting constructions was experimentally verified. For this purpose, a laboratory station and a rigid equivalent of the flaccid membrane were created, thus ensuring the reproducibility of the experiments. For LED-based illuminators, printed circuit boards were also designed, which eliminated the impact of changes in the position of light sources. Thanks to this, it was possible to determine the actual impact of the illuminator's construction on the obtained reconstruction result. The tests were performed for several selected light sources.

Decomposition-based MOEAs are efficient for population diversity, especially when the branch partitions the objective space of multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a series of subspaces, and each subspace retains a set of solutions. However, a persisting challenge is how to strengthen the population convergence while maintaining diversity for decomposition-based MOEAs. To address this issue, we first define a novel metric to measure the contributions of subspaces to the population convergence. Then, we develop an adaptive strategy that allocates computational resources to each subspace according to their contributions to the population. Based on the above two strategies, we design an objective space partition-based adaptive MOEA, called OPE-MOEA, to improve population convergence, while maintaining population diversity. Finally, 41 widely used MOP benchmarks are used to compare the performance of the proposed OPE-MOEA with other five representative algorithms. For the 41 MOP benchmarks, the OPE-MOEA significantly outperforms the five algorithms on 28 MOP benchmarks in terms of the metric hypervolume.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2019.2898456","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars in Hunan Province; National Defense Technology Innovation Special Zone Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666146","Adaptive strategy;contribution metric;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective;objective space partition","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Convergence;Measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Sorting","","","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Concentration of Zr increased after annealing, while Ti and N concentrations decreased due to annealing. Annealing led to 5-10% decreasing of the size of crystallites. Calculated lattice parameters appeared to be a little bit larger in comparison with standard values (1% larger for ZrN and 0.6% larger for TiN) both for as-deposited and annealed samples due to compressive stresses.","","978-1-5386-2810-2","10.1109/NAP.2017.8190365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190365","TiN/ZrN;multilayers;nanoscale;annealing;structure","Coatings;Annealing;Tin;Nanoscale devices;Zirconium;Ions","annealing;compressibility;crystallites;lattice constants;multilayers;nanocomposites;nanofabrication;scanning-transmission electron microscopy;secondary ion mass spectra;thin films;titanium compounds;transmission electron microscopy;vacuum deposited coatings;X-ray diffraction;zirconium compounds","thin films;compressive stress;lattice parameter;crystallite size;zirconium concentration;crystalline plane;HRTEM;STEM;XRD;nitrogen atmosphere;sequential vacuum-arc deposition;annealing;multilayered nanocomposite coatings;temperature 700 degC;size 7 nm to 17 nm;TiN-ZrN","","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed absorber consists of an air layer, a patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO) film, and two layers of superstrate from an FR4 slab and a Teflon slab. The patterned ITO film is a resistive sheet to dissipate the received electromagnetic energy. The proposed absorber does not require the feed network, which is complicated for bipolarized and balanced TCA antennas.

One of the important trends is to work towards development of cognitive systems which are capable to process and analyze complex data using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools and techniques. Therefore, cognition can be already viewed as a requirement for hyper-connected environments e.g., the factories of the future or the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, there is a need to represent and store the data collected from machines in a format that can be understood and manipulated by both humans and machines. This is feasible by designing and implementing semantic models i.e., ontologies which, in turn, enable inferring implicit data of explicit knowledge, leading to cognition. Moreover, there is a need of granting the access to such information remotely and at system runtime. Within this conceptual article, the authors present a semantic workbench that was developed during a European project aiming at utilization of ontologies for knowledge representation and reasoning in industrial automation systems. Further, this research work proposes the encapsulation of semantic workbench as a service in order to be deployed in cloud-based platforms, hence, enabling remote access of authorized clients at system runtime.

All classifications followed the Corine land cover nomenclature. Three different study areas in Europe were selected during 2015 and 2016 campaigns to maximize diversity of land cover. Overall accuracies (OA), ranging from 70% to 90%, were achieved depending on the study area and methodology, considering between 9 and 15 classes.

The overall potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover mapping was evaluated as very good. In all cases, coherence-based results provided higher accuracies than intensity-based strategies, considering 12 days of temporal sampling of the Sentinel-1 A stack. Both coherence and intensity prove to be complementary observables, increasing the overall accuracies in a combined strategy.

Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4)","","2018","","","1","5","The last decade is the time of a very dynamic development of lighting technology. This development covers many areas that complement each other. The development of light sources, luminaires, measurement techniques and design methods make it necessary to develop new, effective tools to support the design and analysis of lighting equipment. In lighting technology, the most common analysis is made of such parameters as the illuminance, luminance distribution and discomfort glare, inseparable from the specificity of modern light sources. A characteristic feature of almost all of them is high luminance, on the level of 107- 108cd/m2. High luminance facilitates the design of very precise optical systems, but also it is strongly associated with the possibility of discomfort associated with glare. Current methods of glare analysis in simulation software are related to conversion to the average luminance value of the luminaire, saved as simplified light parameters in electronic files (IES, LDT or similar). Currently the calculations take place as a result of calculation ratio the value of luminous intensity in a given direction and the surface area of the dimension of the luminaires in the same direction. This can lead to a significant understatement of the luminance of the luminaire in any situation where luminous intensity comes from the heterogeneous luminance distribution on the surface of the luminaire. This situation most often occurs in luminaires with high-luminance light sources with a reflector system and in the case of multi-source luminaires with lenses - eg multi-LED luminaires. The paper presents advanced methods of luminance modelling of light sources developed as a result of digital measurements of luminance distributions. A comparative analysis of the accuracy of the simulation calculations of the analytical lighting fixture model will be presented. The results will be compared to the classic ray tracing methods used in currently used models.","","978-1-5386-7924-1","10.1109/LUMENV.2018.8521083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521083","luminance measurements;ILMD;light source models;simulations","Light sources;Lighting;Optical filters;Solid modeling;Optical reflection;Optical variables control;Pollution measurement","light sources;lighting","design methods;lighting equipment;lighting technology;discomfort glare;modern light sources;glare analysis;average luminance value;simplified light parameters;luminous intensity;heterogeneous luminance distribution;high-luminance light sources;multisource luminaires;luminance distributions;analytical lighting fixture model;advanced luminance modeling;lighting parameters;dynamic development;measurement techniques;optical systems;simulation software;electronic files;reflector system;digital measurements;multiLED luminaires","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Typical Causes of Errors During Measuring Luminance Distributions in Relation to Glare Calculations","S.

Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4)","","2018","","","1","5","The number of high luminance light sources commonly used in lighting technology is systematically growing, causing an increase in number of potential problems. One of them is the problem of discomfort glare and ways to measure it. Both calculation and measurement methods connected with this parameter have a series of disadvantages and advantages. Among the serious disadvantages, there can be dominant digital “models” of light sources and luminaires, which do not include, practically, any direct information on luminance distribution. To make the measurement results correspond to the calculation results, computer simulations and visual impression of the people assessing the lighting, the measuring devices should correctly record the analyzed parameters. The accurate parameters recording means the situation under which the measurement result is possibly close to what the human eye records. The modern measurement systems, among which there are undoubtedly ILMDs - Imaging luminance measuring devices, are potentially ideal to record all parameters used to calculate glare. Research done by the author proves that especially as far as the small light sources are concerned, such as LEDs and multi-source luminaire systems the parameters of the equipment used have a big influence on the measurement results. Especially, an angular field of view of single pixel of the digital sensor, which relates to a CCD or CMOS sensor size, dimensions of single photo-cell, focal length and technology that is used to make this device (B/W, color). A problem of the influence of depth of field of digital recording equipment with respect to the measured luminance values was dealt with. In this paper and presentation, the relationships of ILMD parameters, such as a field of view of a given type of sensor and single photo-element, including the used lens, will be presented.","","978-1-5386-7924-1","10.1109/LUMENV.2018.8521136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8521136","luminance measurements;ILMD;sharp depth of field of lens;glare","Light sources;Lighting;Lenses;Area measurement;Light emitting diodes;Imaging;Meters","brightness;light sources;optical variables measurement;photodetectors","dominant digital models;digital recording equipment;ILMD parameters;luminance distribution measurement methods;imaging luminance measuring devices;human eye recording;discomfort glare calculations;high luminance light source technology;LED;multisource luminaire systems;digital sensor;CMOS sensor;CCD sensor;photocell;lens","","","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While long-term and seasonal height changes are well observed in GPS height time series, the subseasonal deformations are less well resolved. A suite of predictions based on a remote sensing based Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)-assimilating land surface model suggest significant high-frequency changes observable in GPS height time series (with periods between 15 and 90 days). This physical model is then adopted for separating the deterministic component of time series from the stochastic noise and is compared with the conventional harmonic functions modeling, a commonly used approach with predefined annual and semiannual periods. The noise parameters (spectral index and amplitude) associated with the two methods are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that the GRACE-assimilated model output removes the effect of high-frequency hydrological deformations, producing less correlated residuals. Among other aspects, our results highlight the importance of assimilating GRACE-based remotely sensed total water storage data into hydrological models to obtain unbiased estimates of GPS vertical velocity and its uncertainty which is in demand in a range of applications such as the upcoming reference frame realizations.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.2983045","Project under the Ministry of National Defense Republic of Poland Program--Research Grant; DFG NEROGRAV Project which aims at developing methods for validating GRACE -FO; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9061011","GPS height time series;Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) remote sensing;hydrological model;noise analysis.","Global Positioning System;Time series analysis;Harmonic analysis;Strain;Deformable models;Data models;Loading","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Given that the posterior distribution is not analytically tractable, a hybrid learning procedure is designed for combining the variational inference with a gradient-based method to obtain optimal approximate posteriors. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a number of comparative experiments are conducted and analyzed by using the datasets (including artificial and real world ones) coming with different proportions of missing outputs.

However, fields such as computational statistics, data analysis, and geometry usually emphasize the role of equivariances to various geometrical transformations in aggregation processes. Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional data fusion task, both requirements are often compatible with each other. Nevertheless, in this paper, we show that, in the multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are monotone and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted centroids. Even more, this result still holds after replacing monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance by the weaker property of orthomonotonicity. This implies that the aforementioned approaches to the aggregation of multidimensional data are irreconcilable, and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must choose between monotonicity and a desirable behavior with regard to orthogonal transformations.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2908135","Czech Science Foundation; Raúl Pérez-Fernández; Research Foundation of Flanders; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675953","Centroid;monotonicity;multidimensional data aggregation;orthogonal equivariance","Aggregates;Data aggregation;Data analysis;Geometry;Data integration;Task analysis","data aggregation;geometry;sensor fusion;set theory;transforms","over-simplistic weighted centroids;orthogonal equivariance;orthogonal transformations;information fusion;order-preserving process;geometrical transformations;multidimensional data aggregation","","","40","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the DAQ works under harsh radiation environment, there is a fair chance of data corruption due to various energetic particles like alpha, beta, or neutron. Hence, a major challenge in the development of DAQ in the HEP experiment is to establish an error resilient communication system between front-end sensors or detectors and back-end data processing computing nodes. Here, we have implemented the DAQ using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) due to some of its inherent advantages over the application-specific integrated circuit. A novel orthogonal concatenated code and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) have been used to mitigate the effects of data corruption in the user data. Scrubbing with a 32-b CRC has been used against error in the configuration memory of FPGA. Data from front-end sensors will reach to the back-end processing nodes through multiple stages that may add an uncertain amount of delay to the different data packets. We have also proposed a novel memory management algorithm that helps to process the data at the back-end computing nodes removing the added path delays. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FPGA-based DAQ utilizing optical link with channel coding and efficient memory management modules can be considered as first of its kind.

Scalar weighting factors, which are generally used in classic direct model predictive control (CDMPC), are difficult to select. Studies over weighting factor elimination is therefore of considerable significance. The proposed method in this work uses cascaded cost functions, which represent control objectives, without requiring any penalty coefficients, thereby reducing the tedious weighting factor tuning process. Meanwhile, the proposed strategy maintains the merits of CDMPC with good control dynamics and shows robustness for its control coefficients. Lastly, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed CPC are proved by simulation data.","","978-1-5386-6054-6","10.1109/PEAC.2018.8590301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8590301","Cascaded predictive control;Induction motor drives;Three-level NPC power converter","Switches;Stators;Induction machines;Torque;Predictive control;Cost function;Rotors","induction motor drives;machine control;power convertors;predictive control","control coefficients;three-level NPC power converter fed induction machine drives;3L-NPC;scalar weighting factors;factor elimination;cascaded cost functions;control dynamics;robustness;direct model predictive control","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to a greater concentration of pollution and increased temperature in urban areas. A proper urban design may promote the air flow and mitigate these negative phenomena. This paper describes a novel approach to detect and analyze the potential urban ventilation corridors. The concept is based on the morphometric analyses, where roughness parameters (such as roughness length and displacement height), as well as porosity are investigated as opposed to previous studies. Commonly available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data enable more detailed terrain study, as the topography and obstacle features (type, dimensions, and porosity) might be investigated. In comparison to the previous studies and long adapted practices, this approach takes advantage of all information incorporated in LiDAR data to deliver even more accurate results. The comparison of the detected corridors, with the officially designed corridors in our study area in Warsaw, suggests inaccuracies in their extent (only 40% of their areas might still be functioning) and calls for an evaluation. The results deliver areas that may be recognized as urban ventilation corridors and serve as air regeneration and ventilation system. They may also be used for developing new solutions for continuously evolving cities.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2791410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268056","Drag coefficient for vegetation;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);morphometric methods;roughness parameters;urban ventilation corridors","Urban areas;Ventilation;Wind speed;Air pollution;Computational modeling","optical radar;porosity;terrain mapping;town and country planning;ventilation;wind","air flow;roughness parameters;porosity;LiDAR data;air regeneration;ventilation system;wind velocity;urban design;Urban Ventilation Corridors Mapping;detailed terrain","","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For instance, it might be impossible to determine the importances of individual features or to assess the effects of increasing the values of predictors on the behavior of a chosen response variable. Such properties are especially important in software plagiarism detection, where we are faced with the combination of degrees to which how much a code chunk A is similar to (or contained in) B as well as how much B is similar to A.

AMPL is a comprehensive algebraic modeling language for formulating optimization problems. However, AMPL itself does not support defining tasks to be executed in parallel. Although the parallelism is often provided by solvers, in many cases, it is more efficient to formulate the problem in a decomposed way and apply various problem specific enhancements. Parampl introduces explicit asynchronous execution of AMPL subproblems from within the program code.

In this paper we focus on a case study of a security operations platform, whereby typical layers of information processing are integrated with a new database engine dedicated to approximate analytics. The engine makes it possible for the security experts to query massive log event data sets in a standard relational style. The query outputs are received orders of magnitude faster than any of the existing database solutions running with comparable resources and, in addition, they are sufficiently accurate to make the right decisions about suspicious corner cases. The engine internals are driven by the principles of information granulation and summary-based processing. They also refer to the ideas of data quantization, approximate computing, rough sets and probability propagation. In the paper we study how the engine's parameters can influence its performance within the considered environment.

We find that the recently suggested empirical prescription of consequential angular momentum loss (CAML) brings into agreement predicted and observed space densities of CVs and period bouncers. To progress with our understanding of CV evolution it is crucial to understand the physical mechanism behind empirical CAML. Our changes to the BSE code are also provided in details, which will allow the community to accurately model mass transfer in interacting binaries in which degenerate objects accrete from low-mass main-sequence donor stars.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/sty1421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8434819","methods: numerical;stars: evolution;novae, cataclysmic variables","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Increasing the accuracy of this process requires processing many contingencies possibly with the help of time-domain simulations (TDS), which are highly time consuming and computationally expensive, but allow providing reliable results. This paper introduces probabilistic prioritization (PP) as a method to select critical N-k contingencies and provide an efficient identification of the critical ones by a reduction of the number of TDS. Although PP pays attention only to probabilities of contingencies, it utilizes the concept of risk accuracy, in order to provide a stopping criterion for TDS used to assess the costs resulting from particular contingencies. Moreover, the PP method is general and may be applied in other risk assessment processes. The extended IEEE39 system was used to investigate the PP method and the results show that the reduction of the TDS number is around 31 % for PP, when compared with a reference case, where contingency filtering was not applied.","","978-1-5386-3596-4","10.1109/PMAPS.2018.8440253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440253","Power system dynamics;power system stability;risk analysis;stochastic processes;time-domain analysis","Power system stability;Probabilistic logic;Risk management;Stability criteria;Power system dynamics;Time-domain analysis","power system security;power system stability;risk analysis;risk management","TDS number;contingency filtering;probabilistic prioritization;risk-based contingency screening methods;dynamic risk assessment;power systems;time-domain simulations;risk assessment processes;extended IEEE39 system","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its throughput is limited by the inherent dependencies existing in the algorithm. As a consequence, a higher bin parallelism leads to lower clock frequencies. This paper presents an architecture able to exceed limits existing in previous hardware implementations. The architecture exploits less probable symbols as starting points for long series of bins coded in one clock cycle. The evaluation for four possible cases of the range value allows its update in the pipeline before the delayed selection based on actual value. The adaptive division into series is proposed to make long series more frequent. To shorten critical paths, rMPS variables computed for symbols coded in the same clock cycle are first summed and then added to the low register. Up to 16 bypass-mode symbols can be processed in parallel with context-coded symbols in one clock cycle. The architecture is generative, i.e., its throughput can be scaled with resources without strict limits. For example, the binary arithmetic coder synthesized on 90nm TSMC technology which consumes 101.4k gates and operates at the 570 MHz has the average throughput of 13.4 bins per clock cycle for the high-quality H.265/HEVC compression.","1558-0806","","10.1109/TCSI.2019.2949882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8897118","CABAC;binary arithmetic coding;entropy coding;video encoder;VLSI;FPGA;UHDTV;H264/AVC;H265/HEVC","Registers;Throughput;Encoding;Clocks;Computer architecture;Standards;Streaming media","arithmetic codes;binary codes;data compression;high definition television;video coding","video compression standards;clock frequencies;hardware implementations;clock cycle;range value;context-coded symbols;binary arithmetic coder;multisymbol architecture;UHDTV video encoders;binary arithmetic coding;bypass-mode symbols;bin parallelism;size 90.0 nm;frequency 570.0 MHz","","","15","IEEE","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Developing the proper pricing strategies is becoming increasingly important to all market participants in the competitive electric power markets. The goal of this paper is to present a price - forecasting method which uses optimized set of parameters to predict the price for the next hour. The model consists of an objective function describing the minimum difference between real price for current hour and forecasted price for the same hour. It is constrained by four equations describing current demand, supply, price and also its forecasted values.

Lighting Conference of the Visegrad Countries (Lumen V4)","","2018","","","1","5","The article presents a solution to the problem of work and time consuming of the objects floodlighting projects creation. Currently, the only technically correct methods for creating such projects are a three-dimensional computer simulation using photometric files of luminaires or field trials using real equipment. Both of these methods have their advantages, but also many disadvantages. Among architects, in turn, a popular method of floodlighting designing is graphic processing of daytime or evening images objects. The method is relatively fast and it gives photorealistic effects but it is technically incorrect. An architect or graphic designer creates a picture that is attractive to the eye, but usually has nothing to do with reality. This is due to the fact that the lighting parameters of both lighting equipment and analyzing this type of project in terms of technology are not taken into account. The article presents a solution to this problem. It describes a system created especially for this purpose based on a dedicated computer application that allows simulation of the object floodlighting using its daily photograph. This is technically correct simulation, because it uses photometric files of luminaires. The system allows correction of basic photometric parameters: editing of photometric files, luminous flux, light in different directions, color temperature and the use of color filters. The computer application also enables photo editing, geometric correction, measurement and defining reflection and transmission properties of materials from which the object is actually built. Full lighting analysis is also possible and is based on luminance and illuminance distributions generated in the false color scale and measurements in points and selected areas.

Bearing this in mind, in this article, a hierarchical granular computing (HGrC)-based model is established for constructing long-term PIs, in which probabilistic modeling gives rise to a long horizon of numeric prediction, and the deployment of information granularities hierarchically extends the result to be interval-valued format. Considering that the structure of this model has a direct impact on its performance, Monte-Carlo search with a policy gradient technique is then applied for reinforcement structure learning. Compared with the existing methods, the size (length) of the granules in the proposed approach is unequal so that it becomes effective for not only periodic but also nonperiodic data. Furthermore, with the use of parallel strategy, the efficiency can be also guaranteed for real-world applications.

However, most of the existing methods used to construct GFMs are based on the principle of optimal allocation of information granularity, which requires that a numeric model be provided in advance. In this paper, a straightforward and convincing modeling method is proposed to directly construct GFM on a basis of experimental data. The method first granulates the output space to form some interval information granules with distinct semantics and then uses them to partition the entire input space into a series of input subspaces. Subsequently, an initial GFM is emerged by using ``If-Then'' rules to relate with those interval information granules positioned in the output space and structures expressed in prototypes that are produced by clustering individual input subspaces.

In the paper, such a solution is presented and experimentally verified. In the proposed system, user's location is derived using BLE based fingerprinting. A radio map utilized by the algorithm is created automatically during system operation with the support of UWB subsystem.

Secondly, it uses, in the digital part of ADC, a simple iterative algorithm for the calculation of output codes instead of the conventional method which combines the output bits produced by subsequent stages of the pipeline ADC.

"Multimode Stepped-Impedance Resonator (SIR) with Central Via-Coupling for UWB Filter Design","M. Zukocinski","Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, 00-665, Poland","2019 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)","","2019","","","1","4","This paper discusses a new type of planar stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) - a structure centrally loaded with a via to the ground. The novel SIR has unique properties which can be used to design wideband and ultra-wideband (UWB) filters. The shunt via provides a strong inductive coupling in the centre of the structure, which determines a new mechanism of coupling the SIR modes. The central via modifies electromagnetic field distribution of the SIR filter creating in its frequency response an additional transmission pole in the passband. It also provides a transmission zero at DC, which allows for a direct contact port coupling, with no need for the more problematic, very narrow gaps to couple the structure with input/output lines. Thanks to this, the new SIR can be successfully designed and fabricated on thin dielectric substrates. The gapless couplings require impedance matching between input/output lines and the SIR. This is realized by stepped-impedance transformer sections. Depending on the filter bandwidth, these port matching sections can be non-resonating, or begin to resonate generating additional transmission poles. These properties are discussed in the paper based on two example microstrip bandpass filters: a 4-pole 3.1 - 4.8 GHz and a 6-pole 3.1 - 10.6 GHz UWB filter.","2164-2974","978-1-5386-5944-1","10.1109/RWS.2019.8714429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714429","microwave filter;ultra-wideband filter;stepped-impedance resonator;via coupling;gapless structure","Band-pass filters;Microwave filters;Resonator filters;Matched filters;Couplings;Filtering theory;Passband","band-pass filters;frequency response;impedance matching;microstrip filters;microwave filters;microwave resonators;resonator filters","SIR modes;electromagnetic field distribution;SIR filter;additional transmission pole;direct contact port coupling;gapless couplings;impedance matching;stepped-impedance transformer sections;multimode stepped-impedance resonator;central via-coupling;UWB filter design;ultra-wideband filters;inductive coupling;input-output lines;microstrip bandpass filters;frequency response;transmission zero;thin dielectric substrates;frequency 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their popularity implies increasing power ranges what often may be assured by parallel connection of DC/DC ES converters for example in an Input Parallel Output Parallel (IPOP) manner. On the other hand, varying voltage of the ES results in various power range of the system, thus in given conditions all parallel operating converters are not necessarily required and may even worsen the overall efficiency. Then, a dynamic connection or disconnection (engaging and dismissing) of parallel devices is required regarding to actual power demands and ES's voltage level. When the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter is used as the DC/DC topology it may be easily performed by setting zero signals for all transistors of the whole converter. Unfortunately, repetitive engaging and dismissing the whole converter module stresses its components such high frequency transformer's and power mosfets. This may result in harmful EMF introduction and affects overall reliability. This paper presents a simple method to improve process within a two-module IPOP DAB system in a manner where currents overshoots are reduced. It is achieved by adequate modulation modification and proper perfilter application. The idea is finally validated by simulation.","2643-2978","978-1-5386-6376-9","10.1109/ICIT.2019.8755150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755150","DAB;IPOP;Energy Storage;optimization;transient states","","bridge circuits;DC-DC power convertors;electric potential;energy storage;high-frequency transformers;power generation reliability;power MOSFET;renewable energy sources","parallel devices;actual power demands;converter module;two-module IPOP DAB system;currents overshoot;power electronics;renewable sources;power range;dynamic connection;dual active bridge converter;energy storages;total energy market;DC-DC ES converters;input parallel output parallel manner;parallel operating converters;ESs voltage level;high frequency transformer;power mosfets;EMF;adequate modulation modification","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A 5.8–10.6 GHz UWB filter using novel SIR structure","M. Żukociński","Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland","2018 22nd International Microwave and Radar Conference (MIKON)","","2018","","","477","480","The paper presents a set of 3 ultra-wideband bandpass filters for the upper UWB band (5.8 GHz to 10.6 GHz). The filters are development versions of a novel multi-mode stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) planar structure with central via to ground. The new SIR is implemented in microstrip technology. It has a single centrally located via to ground which provides a new mechanism for coupling of the SIR modes. The first filter presented in the paper follows the basic concept of the new SIR whereas the other two filters exploit longitudinal symmetry to bisect the SIR and create half-structures. The second filter uses an in-line cascade of two half-structures while the third filter is a folded cascade of the two half-structures. These examples show basic properties with pros and cons of the new SIR. The cascade of the two half-structures is used to easily increase resultant filter order and performance of frequency characteristics. Folding the cascade can be used to build a new filter structure with some potentially interesting properties. One of the benefits of the presented SIR filters is a direct contact port coupling and no need for more problematic very narrow gaps to couple the structure with the input and output lines. This in turn allows for making the new filters on thin substrates. Another benefit is an extended stop band comparing to the classic SIR.","","978-83-949421-1-3","10.23919/MIKON.2018.8405261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405261","bandpass filter;ultra-wideband (UWB);stepped-impedance resonator (SIR);multi-mode resonator (MMR)","Band-pass filters;Microwave filters;Resonator filters;Couplings;Matched filters;Substrates;Filtering theory","band-pass filters;microstrip filters;resonator filters;ultra wideband technology","ultra-wideband bandpass filters;microstrip technology;SIR planar structure;SIR filters;multimode stepped-impedance resonator;UWB filter;frequency 5.8 GHz to 10.6 GHz","","1","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal for simulation stage is thus to choose most promising solution fulfilling specified requirements and rough estimation of chosen stressors levels. Time limitations and the demand on high quality already at the MVP stadium of the power supply development, raise a need to develop a simple and fast method for thermal modeling of critical components used in the designed power supply.

Validated prediction of the thermal-hydraulics during the depressurization is important by virtue of wide implementation of pressurized vessels in chemical and power engineering. Particular emphasis was put on the implementation of the vessel in the field of steam storage and as the reactor pressure vessel of the boiling water reactor design. In both cases, the vessel is filled up to a certain level with saturated liquid water. The rest of the vessel is occupied by saturated steam. In case of the pressure decrease e.g. due to discharging of the steam from the vessel or due to the loss of coolant accident in a nuclear power plant, the liquid water evaporates abruptly, being a reason, thereby, of strong transients in the vessel. These transients and the sudden emergence of void in the region occupied at the beginning by liquid, cause elevation of the two-phase mixture. Prediction of this elevation - called the water level swell - is important from the view point of safe operation of the device. In this work, a model calculating liquid water collapse level and two-phase level swell is presented and validated against experimental data. The comparison of the model with the reference shows a good agreement.","","978-1-5386-6143-7","10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8388234","thermal-hydraulics;level swell;vessel depressurization;Modelica","Mathematical model;Liquids;Object oriented modeling;Correlation;Heat transfer;Heating systems;Pressure measurement","fission reactor accidents;fission reactor coolants;fission reactor cooling;heat transfer;light water reactors;nuclear engineering computing;pressure vessels;two-phase flow;water","liquid water collapse level;two-phase mixture;loss-of-coolant accident;water thermal-hydraulic model;liquid water evaporates;saturated steam;saturated liquid water;boiling water reactor design;reactor pressure vessel;pressurized vessels;depressurization;heat transfer;water dynamics;saturation conditions","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its direct measurement is difficult, however, it can be determined indirectly from bulk electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity measurements based on theoretical or empirical models. This paper presents an application of one of those models - the salinity index model - for soil salinity characterization. Complex relative dielectric permittivity spectra of soil samples were measured in 0.05-3 GHz frequency range and then the multipole Debye model was fitted to those measurements in order to determine soil bulk electrical conductivity and the contribution of the free-water-dipole dielectric relaxation to dielectric permittivity. The linear relation between soil bulk electrical conductivity and high-frequency dielectric permittivity was obtained for the tested silt-loam soil which was consistent with the salinity index model. These results confirmed that the salinity index model can be applied using the proposed methodology to determine the soil salinity.","","978-1-5386-0480-9","10.1109/IMWS-AMP.2017.8247431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247431","soil complex relative dielectric permittivity;vector network analyzer;salinity index model","Dielectrics;Soil;Salinity (geophysical);Permittivity;Conductivity;Indexes;Permittivity measurement","electrical conductivity;permittivity measurement;salinity (geophysical);soil;water","silt-loam soil;dielectric permittivity spectra;dielectric permittivity measurements;high-frequency dielectric permittivity;free-water-dipole dielectric relaxation;soil bulk electrical conductivity;multipole Debye model;soil samples;salinity index model;soil pore-water electrical conductivity;soil salinity characterization;frequency 0.05 GHz to 3.0 GHz","","1","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The efficiency of the combustion process and spark ignition engines fuel economy depend significantly on ignition circuit providing high voltage to discharge a spark between the electrodes of a spark plug. Hence, spark plugs parameters, their quality and condition are of importance. This paper describes a novel method of spark plug testing based on the low capacitance measurement using a sigma-delta capacitance-to-digital converter. Theoretical spark plug capacitance analysis, some results of spark plugs capacitance measurement and ceramic insulator dielectric constant calculation are presented and discussed.","","978-1-5386-1040-4","10.1109/CPEE.2017.8093041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093041","sigma-delta conversion;capacitance-to-digital converter;spark plug;ceramic insulator;dielectric constant;capacitance measurement;automotive ignition systems","Capacitance;Sparks;Plugs;Insulators;Capacitance measurement;Electrodes;Ceramics","capacitance measurement;ceramic insulators;combustion;fuel economy;ignition;internal combustion engines;permittivity;road vehicles;sparks","ignition circuit;spark plug testing;low capacitance measurement;sigma-delta capacitance-to-digital converter;dielectric properties;road vehicles;spark ignition combustion engines;combustion process;air-fuel mixture;spark plug capacitance analysis;spark plug parameters;spark ignition engine fuel economy;spark plug capacitance measurement;spark plug insulators","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results showed that the real part of dielectric permittivity of the tested products decreased with an increase of frequency, while the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity increased below 14.3 GHz for yoghurt and 13.6 GHz for milks and decreased above those frequencies. During storage the real part of dielectric permittivity of yoghurt and milks slightly decreased. The value of the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity varied much more for milks during time storage. The changes of the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity of the tested products were associated with the changes of pH value. Finally, complex dielectric permittivity spectra of the measured products were modeled with the two-pole and three-pole Debye model.

Yaw and lateral instability in heavy vehicles is one of the main reasons of the traffic accidents and it is even more critical in long combinations where a truck leads multiple towed units. Such vehicle configurations, in lane change maneuvers, exhibit yaw rate and lateral acceleration amplifications, causing tail swings of the towed units. One of such multiple trailer combinations are the B-Doubles combination, in which the fifth wheel coupling is located at the rear of the lead, trailer, which is mounted on the rear section located immediately above the lead trailer axles. The contribution of this work is the design of a linear single track model for the vehicle and to reduce, the Rearward Amplification (RWA) of the yaw dynamics in the three rearmost units of the B-Double combination. This paper presents a dynamic model for the B-double which is simulated for several driving speeds and variations in load.

So far, a variety of evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with more than three objectives. Most of the existing algorithms, however, find difficulties in simultaneously counterpoising convergence and diversity during the whole evolutionary process. To address the issue, this paper proposes to solve MaOPs via multistage evolutionary search. To be specific, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm is developed, where the convergence and diversity are highlighted during different search stages to avoid the interferences between them. The first stage pushes multiple subpopulations with different weight vectors to converge to different areas of the Pareto front. After that, the nondominated solutions coming from each subpopulation are selected for generating a new population for the second stage. Moreover, a new environmental selection strategy is designed for the second stage to balance the convergence and diversity close to the Pareto front. This selection strategy evenly divides each objective dimension into a number of intervals, and then one solution having the best convergence in each interval will be retained. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, 48 benchmark functions with 7, 10, and 15 objectives are used to make comparisons with five representative many-objective optimization algorithms.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2019.2930737","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams; Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen; Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790995","Evolutionary algorithm;many-objective optimization;multistage optimization","Convergence;Sociology;Shape;Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A thorough assessment has been performed, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, while delay-sensitive “critical-process executions” are taking place.

These type of operations bring to bear the Command and Control (C2) and Logistics capabilities of the military to rapidly deploy assets to help with the disaster relief activities. Smart Cities and Smart Environments, embedded with IoT, introduce multiple sensing modalities that typically provide wide coverage over the deployed area. Given that the military does not own or control these assets, they are sometimes referred to as gray assets, which are not as trustworthy as blue assets, owned by the military. However, leveraging these gray assets can significantly improve the ability for the military to quickly obtain Situational Awareness (SA) about the disaster and optimize the planning of rescue operations and allocation of resources to achieve the best possible effects. Fusing the information from the civilian IoT sensors with the custom military sensors could help validate and improve trust in the information from the gray assets.

This goal has its source in several justifications. The first is the need to meet the social and housing needs of households. The second is fuel poverty (energy poverty), including heat (thermal) poverty in Polish households, the natural result of which is the phenomenon of near-ground emissions, being a measure of the level of energy and climate security in local and national terms. The third is the impact of near-ground emissions on the standard of climate safety, as expressed in environmental pollution (of air, soil and water). The fourth is the use of geothermal energy as a significant thermal energy potential which makes it possible to significantly reduce the phenomenon of near-ground emissions and their consequences in terms of energy and climate security. The topics of research addressed in the article will focus on three issues: defining near-ground emissions and their constituent factors; explaining the impact of near-ground emissions on the quality of the natural environment and infrastructure, and showing to what extent geothermal energy can be an important source of heat in combating near-ground emissions as well as responding to the energy and climate security strategy policy. The research problem addressed in the article is theoretical and empirical. The methods used include analysis, definition, synthesis as well as generalization and inference. Such an approach aims to identify the essence and analyse the concepts of the research subject while also defining and demonstrating the dynamics of the phenomena, along with the processes and relations indicated in previous Polish and international literature on the subject. The empirical part of the work uses quantitative and qualitative research methods in order to examine (determine) the magnitude of household heat poverty which leads to near-ground emissions, as well as to determine the temporal and spatial characteristics of atmospheric air pollution.

In the experiments run on two representative network topologies, we assume different number of fibers per link and different number of transceivers available in the network. The main conclusion is that the applied B2B regeneration scenario has a big impact on the network performance, namely, the fully flexible regeneration allows to serve the highest traffic volumes and provides the best scalability with increasing number of utilized fibers.","2161-2064","978-1-5386-6605-0","10.1109/ICTON.2018.8473726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8473726","space division multiplexing;back-to-back regeneration;flexible grid;network optimization","Optical fiber networks;Transceivers;Optical fibers;Modulation;Scalability;Measurement;Network topology","optical communication;space division multiplexing;telecommunication traffic","SS-FON;representative network topologies;fully flexible regeneration;spectrally-spatially flexible optical networks;space division multiplexing;flexible signal regeneration;scalability analysis;flexible-grid spectrally-flexible optical network","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The invasiveness of current ICP monitoring procedures, however, limits the patient pool. Having a non-invasive screening tool for detecting intracranial hypertension would therefore be of high value. In this work, we developed a binary classifier to determine if ICP is above the clinical cutoff value of 20 mmHg. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) recordings serve as the only inputs to the classifier. We identified eighteen ABP and CBFV features reported to correlate with ICP. Given around 32 h of ABP, CBFV and invasive ICP recordings from 36 traumatic brain injury patients, we trained different binary classifiers via leave-one-patient-out cross validation. The random forest classifier resulted in the most stable and accurate prediction, yielding a sensitivity of 69.1% and specificity of 78.3%. These encouraging results and the ease by which features can be added to the framework, suggest possible extensions to include, for example, features derived from venous pressure or near-infrared spectroscopy recordings.","2325-887X","978-1-5386-6630-2","10.22489/CinC.2017.323-004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331719","","Iterative closest point algorithm;Arteries;Radio frequency;Training;Hypertension;Blood;Sensitivity","blood;blood flow measurement;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;brain;diseases;injuries;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","different binary classifiers;leave-one-patient-out cross validation;random forest classifier;venous pressure;intracranial hypertension;random forests;hemorrhagic stroke;intracranial pressure;neurological damage;noninvasive screening tool;binary classifier;traumatic brain injury patients;arterial blood pressure;near-infrared spectroscopy recording;cerebral blood flow velocity recording","","1","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In total, five features were required to classify the cysts. These geometric features represented the location, the area and the convexity of the cyst. The procedure was proven effective on a set 436 varied MRI images. The set contained 68 images with cysts ready for aspiration and was oversampled with the SMOTE approach. The proposed method operates on 2D MRI images. This reduces the time of diagnosis and, with the ever increasing demand for MRI scanners, is justified economically. The method can be employed in systems for autonomous and semi-autonomous Baker's cyst aspiration or as a standalone package for MRI images annotation.

The source of the waste heat were exhaust gases from the internal combustion engine fueled with a biogas (60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide). The engine power was assumed of 700 kW. On the basis of thermodynamic analysis the following results were obtained: the waste heat recovery boiler produced steam at amounts of 158 kg/h at 350°C and 12 bar. The turbine generates power of 24 kW and overall heat-to-electricity efficiency of this power system was approximately 17%.

These models use the summation and ratio of odd-harmonic amplitudes of signal induced by MNPs in the differential pick-up coil, respectively. The simulation results show that there is a large difference between the harmonic amplitudes of monosized and multisized MNPs. The experiments are performed under low-frequency (117 Hz) and weak (30 Oe) sinusoidal ac magnetic field. Therefore, the influence of magnetic relaxations and truncation error on MNTM can be ignored. Experimental results show that the maximum temperature estimation error of model I is about 0.63 K with a standard deviation of 0.21 K, whereas that of model II is about 0.60 K with a standard deviation of 0.32 K in the measurement time of 1 s.

It is known that a surface of solid is a region with the thickness of a few atomic diameters, which have its own atomic structure and property which differs from a bulk. For a large solid with, because correlation of volume of external region to mass be small can ignore external effects. However, for small solids with large surface mass ratio effects grows. The main goal of this study is to predict the elastic and damping properties of composite laminated plates by various boundary conditions, simulating MEMS. This problem has an exact solution of the elasticity for simple homogeneous bends and conditions of lateral loading. This paper presents a new method for stress analysis for the accurate determination of detailed stress distributions in multilayer plates subjected to cylindrical bending. Here are some approximate methods for predicting the stress state for laminated plates. This method is adaptive and is not based on strict assumptions about the plate model. The described theoretical model includes the deformations of each layer of the plate, which take into account the effects of deformation of the transverse shear, transverse normal deformation, and nonlinear displacement changes with respect to the coordinate of thickness.","","978-1-5386-4001-2","10.1109/MEMSTECH.2017.7937526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937526","Composite materials;laminated plates;elastic module;damping;eigenfrequencies","Damping;Face;Vibrations;Clamps;Stress;Frequency-domain analysis","beams (structures);bending;composite materials;damping;elasticity;laminates;micromechanical devices;multilayers;nanoelectromechanical devices;plates (structures);stress analysis","dynamic properties;damping predictions;laminated microbeams;boundary conditions;nanodimension;mechanical properties;thin plates;microdimension;microelectromechanics systems;nanoelectromechanics systems;MEMS simulation;NEMS;atomic diameters;atomic structure;volume correlation;surface mass ratio;composite laminated plates;elasticity;simple homogeneous bends;lateral loading conditions;stress analysis;stress distributions;multilayer plates;cylindrical bending;stress state prediction;transverse shear deformation;transverse normal deformation;nonlinear displacement","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Warsaw,Poland","2019 15th Selected Issues of Electrical Engineering and Electronics (WZEE)","","2019","","","1","6","The paper discusses the problem of reducing cogging torque by combining different minimization methods. Cogging torque is the result of interaction between the magnetic field of permanent magnets on the rotor and the stator with variable magnetic conductivity depending on the angle of rotation. Cogging torque is of pulsating nature and occurs all the time when the machine is operating. It affects the work of the entire device cooperating with the machine causing vibrations, tensions and noise, breaking torque and thereby power losses leading to a faster wear of the machine's construction elements. High values of cogging torque cause problems with the regulation of rotational speed. Cogging torque impedes start-up of dynamos used in the wind power stations thereby making the activation of a power station possible only with high-speed winds. Due to these adverse phenomena the minimization of cogging torque in the machines with permanent magnets is a current issue and the most effective ways of dealing with the problem are highly desirable. Since the costs of prototype construction are very high cogging torque is minimized during the design process and by numerical methods. Computer simulations are used to determine the magnetic circuit with the lowest value of the cogging torque.","","978-1-7281-1038-7","10.1109/WZEE48932.2019.8979823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979823","cogging torque;minimization of cogging torque;finite elements method","","finite element analysis;magnetic circuits;magnetic fields;permanent magnet machines;permanent magnets;rotors;stators;torque;vibrations;wear;wind power plants","permanent magnets;cogging torque reduction methods;multipolar machines;magnetic field;rotor;stator;magnetic conductivity;vibrations;power losses;machine construction element wear;rotational speed regulation;wind power stations;prototype construction;design process;numerical methods;magnetic circuit","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The antennas are to be operated in the stratosphere, where the low air pressure increases the risk of flashover. To analyze the problem, the Paschen's law was applied to three thermodynamic data sets recorded during two different stratospheric balloon missions, launched in December and April 2015 (the April flight also with an experiment of additional heat-up due to solar radiation absorption). To estimate the influence of the humidity present in the cloud layers, a humid flashover case, previously investigated by the RCA on ground, was recalculated for stratospheric environment. The analyses show that the flashover voltage decreases rapidly with pressure-determined altitude and is higher for colder months of the year, which makes the system safer when operated at that time. Higher humidity reduces significantly the maximum flashover voltage, even the air gap remained three times larger than for the dry flashovers. Basic design requirements were formed for the stratospheric antenna mounting insulator in order to maintain the flight safety during high voltage operations.","","978-88-907018-8-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8739554","flashover;high voltage;balloon;antenna systems;Paschen’s law;stratosphere;VLF","Flashover;Insulators;Terrestrial atmosphere;Dipole antennas;Temperature measurement;High-voltage techniques","air gaps;balloons;flashover;humidity;solar radiation;stratosphere","high voltage operations;near-space antenna mounting insulators;long antennas;balloon flight applications;low air pressure;Paschen's law;thermodynamic data sets;April flight;solar radiation absorption;cloud layers;humid flashover case;stratospheric environment;pressure-determined altitude;maximum flashover voltage;air gap;dry flashovers;stratospheric antenna mounting insulator;flight safety;stratospheric balloon missions;heat-up;humidity","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main advantage of AFCS as compare to the known CS is their capability to transmit both analog and digital signals ""perfectly"" that is with a bit rate [bit/s] equal to the capacity of the forward channel ST-BS, maximal accuracy, and fixed bit error rate (reliability). The perfect AFCS are narrowband systems transmitting signals in real time with the energy [bit/J] and spectral [bit/s/Hz] efficiencies attaining the limit values established by information theory. The source of these advantages is replacement of coding units by the analog modulators adaptively adjusted by controls delivered to ST from BS over high-quality feedback channels. The latter one simplifies a construction of the ST transmitters, as well reduces their energy consumption, cost and sizes. Moreover, adaptive properties of AFCS permit to maintain the perfect mode of transmission during overall time of the contact between the satellite and BS. The aim of the paper is presentations of theoretical basis enabling a development and application of improved (perfect) AFCS for ST-BS communications.

Moreover, table-based models offer easy tradeoff between evaluation speed and accuracy. Traditionally, the biggest disadvantage of this class of model has been the inability to take device variability into account. This paper presents a table-based model that can handle process-induced variations of multiple device parameters. The impact of those variations on device operation is modeled analytically using special transformations of the current-voltage and charge-voltage characteristics of the nominal (i.e., variation-free) device. In contrast to multidimensional interpolation between the I-V and Q-V curves of “corner” devices, the proposed approach is much less costly in terms of CPU time, RAM use, and time dedicated to device characterization. The model has been successfully used in statistical simulations of an amplifier and ring oscillator built with VeSFETs-dual-gate junctionless transistors.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2018.2852756","Narodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403271","Dual-gate transistor;look-up table (LUT);process-induced variability;table-based model;VeSFET","Integrated circuit modeling;Table lookup;Semiconductor device modeling;Transistors;Interpolation;Analytical models;Logic gates","circuit simulation;interpolation;junctionless nanowire transistors;oscillators;semiconductor device models;statistical analysis","table-based model;physics-based analytical model;multiple device parameters;process-induced variations;dual-gate transistor;statistical circuit simulation;VeSFET-dual-gate junctionless transistors;charge-voltage characteristics;multidimensional interpolation;ring oscillator","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The formalism emphasizes such features as asynchrony of actions and communication, locality of decisions, and autonomy in executing actions. In conjunction with model checking, IMDS allows to analyze such features of distributed systems as deadlocks or distributed termination. However, the nature of model checking allows to find one deadlock in a single run of the verifier, which produces a counterexample. The conversion of IMDS specification to a Petri net is used to identify multiple deadlocks in one verification, using siphons. Model checking is used to verify if a siphon can become empty, which denotes a true deadlock in a purely cyclic system, like FMS (Flexible Manufacturing Systems). The extension of the verification by temporal checking allows to cover systems with any structure: cyclic, terminating, or with a more complex scheme. In addition, the proposed procedure allows to easily identify processes participating in partial deadlocks. Two types of deadlock can be identified: communication deadlocks and resource deadlocks.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511235","","System recovery;Servers;Model checking;Petri nets;Internet of Things;Frequency modulation;Computer science","concurrency control;flexible manufacturing systems;Internet of Things;operating systems (computers);Petri nets;system recovery","communication deadlocks;siphon-based deadlock detection;model checking;distributed termination;IMDS specification;flexible manufacturing systems;integrated model of distributed systems;IoT;Internet of Things;Petri net","","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A distinctive feature of the presented survey is its focus on new versions of the VRP, which have recently emerged or gained momentum, and the corresponding new solution methods, with particular emphasis on computational intelligence (CI) approaches. The list of newly proposed or currently popular VRP formulations include last mile and same day delivery, crowdshipping, bike sharing systems, post-disaster response plans, local routing in large production or cargo plants, customer-centric VRP, autonomous delivery, unnamed aerial vehicle delivery, green VRP, waste collection VRP, rich VRP, or VRP with backhauls. Simultaneously, an adequate increase of interest in the application of traditional CI methods (e.g., genetic, memetic, ant colony or particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, or their various hybrid versions) can be observed in the VRP domain. At the same time, approaches proven efficient in other optimization areas (e.g., hyperheuristics, methods based on Monte Carlo simulations, algorithms rooted in game theory and bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games, or cognitively motivated methods) have lately entered the VRP field and become a viable alternative to more traditional techniques. Since VRP is one of the fastest growing fields in the operations research area, we believe that an analysis of the recently published VRP papers from the perspective of their novelty in problem formulation and/or applied solution method can provide a true value for the CI community, especially young researchers entering the field and seeking challenges in this interesting and fast developing research area.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2018.2886585","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8591961","Computational intelligence;vehicle routing;combinatorial optimization;metaheuristics","Loading;Vehicle routing;Vehicle dynamics;Computational intelligence;Routing;Transportation;Optimization","ant colony optimisation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cognitive systems;customer services;disasters;environmental factors;game theory;genetic algorithms;goods distribution;industrial plants;Monte Carlo methods;operations research;particle swarm optimisation;simulated annealing;vehicle routing","rich VRP;game theory;cognitively motivated methods;vehicle routing problem;computational intelligence solution methods;operations research;bi-level optimization-Stackelberg games;Monte Carlo simulations;hyperheuristics optimization;simulated annealing;particle swarm optimization;ant colony optimization;genetic algorithm;memetic algorithm;autonomous delivery;cargo plants;production plants;bike sharing systems;crowdshipping;last mile delivery;same day delivery;waste collection VRP;green VRP;unnamed aerial vehicle delivery;customer-centric VRP;post-disaster response plans","","","156","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is visible, especially in the case of city exploitation conditions of the electric vehicle. Independent on the kind of use multispeed transmission its application in pure electric drive required its automated operation, both for vehicle acceleration and deceleration. In the case of Automated Manual Transmission the disadvantage is interrupted driving torque during gear shifting. This negative feature can be removed thanks to the proper drive train structure. One of them is proposed dual motor - single shaft drive structure. It consists of two electric motors. One of them is connected to the multispeed transmission input while the second is connected to the multispeed transmission output shaft and then to the final drive. This way of electric motor arrangement in electric drive structure puts together the benefits of multi speed gearbox application as well as the possibility of vehicles propelling during gear shifting. Additionally, compared to the classic electric drive structure with multispeed transmission, each motor rated power can be limited because the total drive power is the sum of both the motor powers. It is resulting in motors current limitation thus the same the losses are also limited and the drive efficiency increase. It seems that the effect on energy saving can be greater when both motors cooperate together in the proper way. This cooperation depends on both motor torque distribution. The motor torque distribution must be done under best efficiency motor operation condition. In the paper the analyses of the torque distribution influence on efficiency and battery power for the proposed structure of electric drive was done. There was proposed the definition of torque distribution based on the required output torque demand. The factors allowing the evaluation of quality torque distribution have been proposed.","","978-1-5386-4325-9","10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486022","electric drive;torque distribution;automated manual transmission;EV","Torque;Shafts;Gears;Batteries;Energy management;Energy consumption;Wheels","motor drives;torque motors","torque distribution analysis;pure electric drive;electric energy consumption saving;electric vehicle;vehicle acceleration;gear shifting;single shaft drive structure;electric motors;multispeed transmission input;multispeed transmission output shaft;electric motor arrangement;multispeed gearbox application;motor rated power;total drive power;motor powers;motors current limitation;motor torque distribution;quality torque distribution;automated manual transmission;dual motor-single shaft electric drive;drive train structure","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed approach needs only an average of 13 objective-function evaluations, i.e. device simulations, to extract three parameters of a single device. If the parameters of a group of devices of the same type are to be extracted, the average number of simulations drops to four per device. This number is much smaller than in conventional optimization procedures.

This feature, in consequence, results in total drive efficiency increasing, so in the same time the energy consumption decreasing. The use of multispeed transmission in pure electric drive required its automated operation. There are many kinds of mechanical transmission that may be adopted to electric drive. One of them is Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). The advantage of mentioned transmission is relatively simple construction and way of operation as well as its lower price compared to other transmissions.

In the literature, different models of airborne ultrasound transmission have been investigated, but not supported by discussion of the channel theoretical capacity. On the other hand, knowledge of this measure is essential in the design of an efficient communication link and allows identifying its potential areas of applications. In this letter, we calculate estimates of the Shannon limit for five different configurations of airborne ultrasound digital communication channels. Our evaluation is based on the numerical results available in the literature.

Traditionally such systems are presented in transfer function or state matrices forms, the second one being especially convenient for computation with tools such as MATLAB environment. The problem with such approach arises when very large number of forms of dynamic system need to be compared and analysed, as finding similarities and properties is time-consuming or outright impossible due to computational complexity problems. Due to such limitations it is impossible to analyse all possible solutions for given dynamic systems and determine their usability. As solution to such problem alternative approach is proposed, where all possible representations of dynamic system are created using fast GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processor Units) compatible algorithm and stored in the form of directed graphs (digraphs). Creating efficient database architecture for storage of large number (numbering in millions) of such graphs in graph-based database like Neo4j allows us to efficiently analyse a whole set of solutions to find similarities, hidden properties and limitations, while at the same time retaining the ability to store the obtained data for further analysis (especially of more complicated systems) and expand the solution size, efficiently building new solutions on base of simpler solutions stored in the database.","","978-1-5386-4762-2","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2018.8399605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399605","graph databases;Neo4j;dynamic systems;database architecture;NoSQL;GPGPU","Mathematical model;Transfer functions;Computer architecture;NoSQL databases;Heuristic algorithms;Matlab","computational complexity;database management systems;directed graphs;graph theory;matrix algebra","transfer function;dynamic system need;computational complexity problems;directed graphs;complicated systems;dynamic systems;general-purpose computing;database architecture;graph-based database;state matrices","","","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system provides quick and repeatable measurements without the use of flexible microwave cables. Also, application of a portable one-port VNA significantly lowers the cost of the system in comparison to two-port setups.

Setting and marking of allophones boundaries in continuous speech is a difficult issue due to the mutual influence of adjacent phonemes on each other. It is this neighbourhood on the one hand that creates variants of phonemes that is allophones, and on the other hand it affects that the border between allophones is in some cases very difficult to determine. Nowadays, this task is carried out manually in cooperation with specialists in the field of phonetics. The presented approach allows to build a system that is able to automate this process. The aim of the work currently carried out by the author is a method that facilitates the training material processing for the needs of the development of multimodal speech recognition systems. For this purpose, the difficult problem of marking boundaries of allophones is solved in this report based on the Polish dictionary in the context of the creation of allophone bases for speech synthesis. This is done in this way due to the simplified possibility of organizing critical listening and subjective evaluation of received allophones by a large group of Polish native speakers (73 people). Strengthening the method will allow it to be used for the extraction of allophones for the needs of developed system of automatic transcription of English speech and for its notation according to the IPA standard. The analysed continuous speech is combined in the DTW algorithm with a synthesized speech signal. The comparison of both signals is performed not in the time domain as in the classical DTW, but in the frequency domain. This allows for a statement that the phonetic content of both signals is compared. The paper describes the process of marking the boundaries of allophones for the Polish language, however after appropriate modifications, this approach can be used to determine the allophones boundaries in other languages, especially for English.","2326-0319","978-8-3620-6533-2","10.23919/SPA.2018.8563359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8563359","allophoneme analysis;speech processing;Dynamic Time Warping","Databases;Acoustics;Phonetics;Heuristic algorithms;Speech synthesis;Speech recognition","natural language processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis","allophones boundaries;DTW algorithm;multimodal speech recognition systems;allophone bases;speech synthesis;received allophones;English speech;synthesized speech signal;dynamic time warping algorithm;continuous speech analysis","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They should be verified with Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs), which unfortunately have coaxial ports. A CMAD can be connected to the VNA only if it is embedded in adapters. In the verification process, the clamp must be deembedded, i.e. the contribution of adapters must be extracted from the measured S-parameters. The Thru-Reflect-Line TRL calibration of the VNA is a suitable tool for that task, provided the necessary hardware and software facilities of the VNAs are available. If not, alternatives are required. In this paper, the alternative calibration is presented. The symmetry of adapters allows omitting the Reflect-step, providing this approach is preceded with the Short-Open-Thru-Match SOTM calibration. The method presented here consists of two steps only: the Thrustep in which adapters are cascaded face to face and the Linestep in which the rod line is inserted between the adapters. These two standards can have unknown S-parameters. Validation of the method consists in verification of the CMAD available on the market.

During that time, this very well received by the fusion society model became a sort of classics, as emerging solutions for years have been delivered with respect to the JDL's fusion level structure. However, with all the respect for the classic, not all fusion problems can be easily covered by this model. Multi-level fusion is one these problems, where the necessity of cooperation with diverse models often becomes critical if the operation levels do not refer directly the exact levels of JDL model. This paper presents a concept of the polymorphic information exchange model, which can be applied for the multi-level fusion purposes. The polymorphism enables the designer to release from the assumption of any predefined structure of the information exchange model.","","978-0-9964527-6-2","10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455324","multi-level fusion;JDL model;polymorphic model;soft information;hard information;context","Object oriented modeling;Data models;Information exchange;Adaptation models;Context modeling;Data structures","modelling;sensor fusion","diverse models;JDL model;polymorphic information exchange model;multilevel fusion purposes;miscellaneous fusion problems;fusion society model;JDL fusion level structure;Joint Directors of Laboratories model","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The roughness parameters mapping focuses mainly on frontal area index calculation and itis based on the building database partially derived from satellite imagery (SPOT). Comparison of the derived corridors with the officially planned preservation areas suggests inaccuracies in their extent, identifies obstacles that occurred over almost twenty years and calls for an evaluation.

This block is part of original sub-ranging ADC whose working principle is based on the assumption that sub-ADC and sub-DAC exhibit high linearity while they nominal resolutions remain relatively low. The linearity of the presented flash ADC has to be as high as in case of 8-bit converter. Thus, the most challenging task was to design comparator with resolution of ±1.5 mV. This goal was reached owing to ability offered by the FD-SOI process to trim transistor's threshold voltage by means of modulating the back-gate polarization. The resulting sampling rate is 500 Ms/s.","","978-83-63578-16-9","10.23919/MIXDES.2019.8787023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787023","Flash ADC;thermometer-to-binary encoder;bubble error correction;comparator;FD-SOI;back-gate polarization;mismatch compensation;process variability","Linearity;Resistors;Latches;Transistors;Analog-digital conversion;Threshold voltage;Logic gates","analogue-digital conversion;comparators (circuits);digital-analogue conversion;silicon-on-insulator","design comparator;type analog-to-digital converter;22 nm FD-SOI technology;sub-ADC;8-bit converter;flash ADC;original sub-ranging ADC;highly linear 4-bit flash ADC;back-gate polarization;sampling rate","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These requirements are met by superconducting fault current limiters which use the phenomenon of transition of a superconducting material from the superconducting state to the resistive state as a results of exceeding the critical current Ic of the superconducting material [1]-[3]. An inductive fault current limiter is a triple-winding construction consisting of two superconducting windings and one copper winding, which are magnetically coupled with each other. Both superconducting windings are wound simultaneously on one carcass, which allows to obtain a very large magnetic coupling coefficient between the windings, minimize the dispersion reactance of the limiter, which in turn minimizes the voltage at the limiter in the waiting state.

In view of each player's strategy to lease additional storage capacity, the game property is analyzed and we prove that the game always admits a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Since the player's decision affects the level of benefit maximization, we elaborate on a cost-optimal storage allocation incentive mechanism, which scales effectively once non-linear or linear demand for storage capacity occurs, towards achieving optimal leasing conditions on cloud storage and computing capacity level. The experimental validation tests prove the effectiveness of the proposed game theoretic approach allocating the requests for more storage capacity in a cost-effective manner, which achieves to maximize the benefits.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987453","distributed cloud;Internet of Things;IoT;Internet of Everything;IoE;cloud storage;data storage allocation;game theory;Nash equilibrium","Cloud computing;Games;Resource management;Companies;Memory;Cost benefit analysis;Nash equilibrium","cloud computing;cost-benefit analysis;data integration;game theory;incentive schemes;Internet of Things;optimisation;virtualisation","Internet of Everything;market-oriented cloud computing;Internet of Things infrastructure virtualization;IoT infrastructure virtualization;capacity planning;data storage;computing capacity level;storage capacity;cloud storage;optimal leasing conditions;nonlinear demand;linear demand;cost-optimal storage allocation incentive mechanism;Nash equilibrium;game property;cost-benefit analysis game;benefit maximization;cloud-centric IoT systems;dynamic storage allocation;game theoretic technique;structured data integration;unstructured data integration;IoT data;data complexity","","4","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the facial key points extracted by Candide-3 model, adaptive feature selection is adopted, namely Plus-L Minus-R Selection is completed. It can determine the features that contribute the most to emotion recognition, thereby forming the basis of emotion classification. Emotion classification is based on AdaBoost-KNN, which builds a series of KNN classifiers. AdaBoost-KNN adjusts the weights of the data in an iterative manner.

Such electric field records were obtained from the local lightning detection system operating in the Rzeszow region. This system consists of two slow and fast electric field sensors working in the ELF and ELF-MF frequency range, respectively. Additionally, the development of the corresponding lightning flash channel can be recorded by the digital high speed video camera. The frequency bandwidth of the electric field fast antenna enable us to recognize properly all main components of lightning discharge observed from the single measuring station. On the other hand, the lightning stepped leader stage of the considered cloud-to-ground flash can be determined from the modified power density spectrograms of related lightning electric field records. Such PSD spectrograms have been integrated in respect to the frequency domain. The only-time-dependent PSD spectrograms have been recalculated by the special computer procedure called the fill factor estimation. This factor has been computed in respect to the following return stroke electric field signature. Next, the leader beginning timestamp has been determined for the particular value of the fill factor. The obtained duration of the lightning leader stage enable us to estimate the lightning channel height for simplified assumptions. The comparison of the downward negative leader model taken from the literature with our lightning electric field records is also shown. The presented computer algorithm can be used for the different kind of lightning electric records. The high efficiency of such lightning leader discrimination has been obtained especially in the cases of close lightning flash incidents when electrostatic field component of the leader stage dominates the total electric field change of the considered lightning stroke. Therefore, this method may be implemented in future by the different kind of lightning detection and location systems without a significant loss of computing power and with low costs.","","978-1-5386-6635-7","10.1109/ICLP.2018.8503326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8503326","lightning leader;lightning channel;lightning location system;power spectrum density","Lightning;Electric fields;Spectrogram;Sensors;Estimation;Channel estimation;Computational modeling","atmospheric techniques;clouds;lightning;video cameras","lightning stepped leader stage;power spectrum density spectrograms;lightning discharge;modified power density spectrograms;return stroke electric field signature;lightning channel height;lightning electric records;lightning leader discrimination;lightning flash incidents;electrostatic field component;total electric field change;location systems;electric field recordings;electric field sensors;lightning stroke;PSD spectrograms;lightning flash channel;local lightning detection system;lightning electric field records;Rzeszow region;digital high speed video camera;electric field fast antenna;cloud-to-ground flash;Poland","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For optimized allocation of limited spectrum and transceiver resources, we develop a dynamic lightpath routing algorithm called adaptive routing with back-to-back regeneration (ARBR), which we evaluate in comparison to other reference methods. Using the ARBR algorithm, we study potential performance gains in terms of bandwidth blocking probability (BBP) in such flexible network scenarios. To this end, we analyze three alternative scenarios that differ in the way in which dynamic translucent lightpath connections are provisioned, namely a reference scenario in which the use of regenerators is minimized and the modulation conversion is not allowed, and two other scenarios with intentional B2B regeneration. The results of extensive simulation experiments run on two representative network topologies show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the reference ones in terms of the BBP metric.

The key idea behind SDM is to exploit the spatial dimension to provide a significant increase in the transmission system capacity. In SDM, optical signals are transmitted in parallel through spatial resources (fibers, cores or modes), thus co-propagating in the same optical fiber structure. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we propose and evaluate several versions of a greedy algorithm for optimization of flexible-grid SDM optical networks, including comparison with optimization results yielded by the CPLEX solver. Second, using best found algorithm settings, we complement our study with an analysis of SDM network performance in terms of the spectrum usage. We report and discuss results of numerical experiments run on a representative network topology with realistic physical assumptions. The key observation is the low scalability of the CPLEX solver, while the greedy algorithm is capable of generating solutions for larger network scenarios.

SDM enables parallel transmission of several co-propagating spatial modes in suitably designed optical fibers, such as multi-core fibers (MCFs). The MCFs are prone to excessive signal impairments due to inter-core crosstalk (XT) that occurs between adjacent cores and affects the transmission quality. Although the effect of XT has been addressed in previous networking studies by considering different approaches for its minimization, still the relation between the level of XT and network performance has not been deeply analyzed. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the worst-case inter-core crosstalk of MCFs on network performance in a spectrally-flexible SDM optical network planning scenario, in which spectral super-channels and multiple modulation formats are used. We apply a transmission reach model that account for both XT and other signal impairments and evaluate two realistic network topologies of different dimensions.

Next, constraints of important states and control variables are a posteriori introduced into control algorithm to provide satisfactory dynamic behaviour and safe operation of the plant. The boundary values of control signals which provide permissible values of the future state-space variables are derived from the models of power converters that take into account two modes of operation (i.e. charging and discharging mode). The novelty of the proposed approach lies in efficient control algorithm that utilises the gain-scheduled SFC with the parameter-dependent constraint handling method. The designed control algorithm is extensively tested through simulation and experiments at a switching frequency of 36 kHz.

In this paper, we expose our solution for multiple-server support to dynamic adaptive streaming applications: Multiple-Source Streaming (MS-Stream). Thanks to its codec agnosticism and DASH-compliance our contribution is a pragmatic and evolving solution for QoE enhancement that can be applied to many streaming architectures (CDNs, Clouds) and is particularly suited for distributed environments such as P2P or Set-Top-Box overlays. In addition, splitting content into multiple independent sub-streams provides the opportunity to achieve easy-to-design bitrate adaptation and server-switching mechanisms. We empirically validate our approach using an extensive collection of network profiles provided by the DASH Industry Forum.

Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is an extension of the CR concept to enable holistic end-to-end optimization of the network operation and services. We discuss CRN management issues in the context of military and tactical operation environments, where the key feature is the temporal nature of the network installations. Our special interest is in the wireless ad hoc network solutions. The network lifetime may extend from just hours to several days. The limited lifetime of the networks makes it both possible and necessary to define the management functionalities with respect to different mission phases. Traditional FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Administration, Performance, and Security) functions and their required actions are therefore detailed to some level at each operational phase (before, during and after mission). We will emerge the idea that, as the cognitive and autonomous technologies will be developed to operate communication networks and become trustworthy enough to be applied also in tactical context, they will most likely first be applied in the during mission phase. Of course, this phase is also the most critical in the sense that it is here that lives are at stake. To answer this critical issue, the policy management must be seen as an equally critical functionality. It is necessary to develop the interconnection between mission goals and defined policies so that the Cognitive Network Engine (CNE) determining the operational parameters of the network, in all situations provides a reliable and failsafe communication solution to be utilized.","","978-1-5386-3858-3","10.1109/ICMCIS.2017.7956487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7956487","cognitive radio networks;network management;military;tactical","Cognitive radio;Engines;Context;Cognition;Optimization;Ad hoc networks;Network topology","cognitive radio;military communication;radio spectrum management;telecommunication network management","network management;military cognitive radio networks;spectrum sensing facilities;decision making logic;radio devices;military operation;tactical operation;wireless ad hoc network;network lifetime;policy management;cognitive network engine","","3","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By avoiding buffer stalling events that are mainly caused by the lack of throughput at client or at server side, HAS protocols increase end-user's Quality of Experience (QoE). We propose to extend HAS capabilities to a pragmatic DASH-compliant Multiple-Source Streaming solution (MS-Stream) that simultaneously utilizes several servers. MS-Stream offers the opportunity to obtain higher QoE by exploiting expanded bandwidth and link diversity in heterogeneous distributed streaming infrastructures, such as distributed home-gateways or geographically distributed set-top-boxes belonging to Over-The-Top video service providers.

To prove properties of an ideal communication protocol, we derive an infinite Diophantine system of equations from it, which is subsequently solved. Then we present the programs htgen and ht-mcrl2-gen, developed in the C language, which generate Petri net and process algebra models of a hypertorus with a given number of dimensions and grid size. These are the inputs for the respective modeling tools Tina and mCRL2, which provide model visualization, step simulation, state space generation and reduction, and structural analysis techniques. Benchmarks to compare the two approaches are obtained. An ad-hoc induction-like technique on invariants, obtained for a series of generated models, allows the calculation of a solution of the Diophantine system in a parametric form. It is proven that the basic solutions of the infinite system have been found and that the infinite Petri net is bounded and conservative.

The fixed q component of power is selected for the rectifier operation. In both targets, the current is sinusoidal, however unbalanced. It does not provide the maximum possible power transfer available at given voltage imbalance. The maximum power can be reached at sinusoidal current. Thus in the case in which the current vector length reaches instantly the maximum value, the current is progressively balanced to increase the value of transferred power.

In fact, STAP algorithms have well-known drawbacks (e.g., large amount of secondary data). The propagation and backscattering of radar signals are included in the covariance matrix calculation. Since the propagation and backscattering have to be derived from physical features of the sea (e.g., sea Doppler) and the atmosphere, we also include the difference induced by the waveform (pulsed radar/chirp) in our study. Moreover, since the inverse covariance matrix is used in the target detection algorithms, matrix conditioning is also inspected for practical implementation reasons. We numerically detail the performance (signal noise clutter ratio and conditioning number of the STAP algorithms) with regards to the MTI performance for several configurations of radar and sea state. These results show that the improvements of signal noise clutter ratio are counterbalanced by a raise of the conditioning number, except in the case of eigencanceler approach.

The article describes an automating of their development. It performs all the stages of cartographic modelling, from data preparation to visualisation of the resulting passability maps in the form of a geoportal. A Vector Map Level 2 (VMap L2) was used as source data. In the described system, passability was relative to the primary grid field in the shape of a square with a defined, arbitrary size, for which data regarding land cover elements, located within this primary field, was prepared. On the basis of this data, spatial analyses were carried out, resulting in the Index of Passability (IOP), determined in a continuous range from 0 (NO GO terrain) to 1 (GO terrain).

Diversity is expressed as a variance or a covariance matrix of individuals contained in the population, in one-or multidimensional cases, respectively. We focus on the exploration stage of the optimization, therefore the fitness function is modeled as noise. We prove that the expected value of genetic diversity achieves a level proportional to the mutation covariance matrix. The proportionality coefficient depends solely on the EA parameters. Formulas are derived to predict the diversity for fitness proportionate, tournament and truncation selection, with and without arithmetic crossover and with Gaussian mutation. Experimental validation of the multidimensional case shows that prediction accuracy is satisfactory in a broad spectrum of settings of EA parameters.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2917275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8716593","evolutionary algorithm;population diversity;noise fitness model.","Sociology;Genetics;Correlation;Covariance matrices;Dispersion;Random variables","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Generally, the models describing processes of targeted cyber attacks are called in the literature as cyber kill chains or rarely cyber-attacks life cycles. Despite the fact that cyber-attacks have random nature, almost no stochastic models of cyber kill chains bases on the theory of stochastic processes have been proposed so far. This work, attempting to fill this deficiency, proposes to start using Markov processes for modeling some cyber-attack kill chains.

Koszykowa 75, 00-662, Poland","2017 Progress in Applied Electrical Engineering (PAEE)","","2017","","","1","7","The dynamic evolution of renewable energy sources (RESs) with utilization of power electronics converters (PECs) caused the situation, where many energy generation units works parallel in local systems named microgrids (MGs). This distributed generation systems with many few kW micro-sources have to provide energy for linear and non-linear loads in grid connected mode of operation, but also in islanded mode of operation, which requires more advanced monitoring and energy management algorithms to ensure power balance and good voltage quality. The issues of power management in islanded AC microgrids are studied by many research centres and novel solutions are necessary to improve the reliability of MGs. In literature, there is still a gap for development of harmonic power sharing method in MG with most often used non-linear loads. Together with active and reactive power management algorithms the harmonic power sharing algorithm need to be implemented in control system to obtain complete solutions. The most often used approach in MG is hierarchical control structure, which includes the basic control loops at primary level, independent for each of PECs and outer control loops at secondary level, which allow to improve voltage amplitude and frequency in point of common coupling, as well as power sharing between PECs. Moreover, the hierarchical control structure is a great opportunity to implement a distributed control algorithm, which is able to execute many operations in the same time. Based on this idea, the novel proportional harmonic power sharing algorithm has been developed. It causes the harmonic power sharing between PECs proportionally to active powers, improving the output current waveforms of converters by decreasing the amplitude of selected current harmonics. The principles of hierarchical droop control and reactive power management has been presented in this paper. The developed solution has been implemented in simulation research together with proportional reactive power sharing algorithm. In order to present the advantage of harmonic power sharing, the results have been compared with non-controlled harmonic power.","","978-1-5386-1528-7","10.1109/PAEE.2017.8008991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008991","microgrid;islanded mode of operation;harmonic power sharing;droop control","Harmonic analysis;Reactive power;Power harmonic filters;Voltage control;Microgrids","distributed control;distributed power generation;energy management systems;power conversion harmonics;power electronics;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation reliability;power grids;reactive power control;renewable energy sources","harmonic power sharing;power electronic converter;islanded AC microgrid;dynamic RES evolution;dynamic renewable energy source evolution;energy generation unit;distributed generation system;islanded mode;grid connected mode;energy management algorithm;voltage quality;power balance;MG reliability improvement;active power management algorithm;reactive power management algorithm;harmonic power sharing algorithm;hierarchical control structure;point of common coupling;distributed control algorithm;hierarchical droop control","","1","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aside from quaternions, used as the main mathematical tool, the orientation recognition is based on determination of an accumulator array for Euler angles. Values in the accumulator are received using so called counting method, adopted here for voxels. Objects orientation is determined by coordinates of an element in the accumulator array with a maximum number of votes received.

We study potential power consumption savings and performance gains in terms of bandwidth blocking probability in such flexible network scenarios. To this end, we analyze two alternative scenarios that differ in the way in which translucent lightpath connections are provisioned, namely, a reference one in which the use of regeneration is minimized and the one with flexible B2B regeneration. For comparing these scenarios, we propose two dynamic routing strategies, one aiming at the minimization of bandwidth blocking probability and the second dedicated to minimization of power consumption. The results of simulation experiments run on two representative network topologies show that flexible signal regeneration can be beneficial in terms of both analyzed metrics.","","978-1-5386-3652-7","10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390373","elastic optical networks;dynamic routing;energy efficiency;back-to-back regeneration","Modulation;Routing;Transponders;Optical fiber networks;Repeaters;Power demand;Energy efficiency","energy conservation;optical fibre networks;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;transponders","energy efficiency;dynamic lightpath provisioning;flexible signal regeneration;modulation conversion;potential power consumption savings;performance gains;flexible network scenarios;translucent lightpath connections;dynamic routing strategies;representative network topologies;translucent elastic optical networks;super-channel transmission;flexible B2B regeneration;power consumption minimization;bandwidth blocking probability","","1","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Virtual Torque and Power Control of a Three-Phase Converter Connected to an Unbalanced Grid With Consideration of Converter Current Constraint and Operation Mode","G. Iwanski","Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warszawa, Poland","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","","2019","34","4","3804","3818","The paper presents a three-phase power converter control under grid voltage imbalance. The proposed method adapts the current imbalance in relation to the inverter or rectifier operation. Under the inverter operation, the control target is to have the nonoscillatory p component of instantaneous power and the xv component of instantaneous virtual torque calculated as the dot product of the grid virtual flux vector and the converter current vector. Then, the phase with lower voltage is supported by higher current. In the rectifier mode, the control target is to have the nonoscillatory q component of power and the Tv component of virtual torque calculated as the cross product of the virtual flux and the converter current. This way, the phase with the highest voltage is loaded by higher current. Unbalanced current obtained in both targets is limited in the way that allows us to limit true phase current and retain sinusoidal current waveforms. However, it does not allow maximum power transfer at the given grid voltage asymmetry, so in order to increase the power value, current progressive balancing is proposed in both operation modes. Finally, converter current balancing is applied also in the case in which a significant amount of reactive power is referenced.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2018.2850014","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395041","AC–DC power conversion;current control;current limiters;power control;torque control","Torque;Rectifiers;Inverters;TV;Oscillators;Voltage control;Reactive power","electric current control;machine control;power control;power convertors;power grids;reactive power control;rectifiers;torque control","grid virtual flux vector;converter current vector;rectifier mode;phase current;sinusoidal current waveforms;maximum power transfer;power value;current progressive balancing;operation modes;converter current balancing;reactive power;power control;three-phase converter;unbalanced grid;converter current constraint;three-phase power converter control;grid voltage imbalance;current imbalance;inverter operation;grid voltage asymmetry;nonoscillatory component;dot product;instantaneous virtual torque;instantaneous power","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Professor Groszkowski received his PhD in 1928 for his work entitled ""The Compensation Method for Controlling Wave Stability"" [1]. He had already published a revolutionary discussion in Polish in 1925 on ""Cathode Waves and Their Use in Radiotelegraphy"", which has since been translated into many languages; the first translation, entitled ""Les Lampes a plusieures electrodes et leurs applications en radiotechnique"", was published in Paris in 1927. In the 1930s, he continued his research in this area, and in 1935 he established the State Telecommunications Institute in Poland, now known as PIT (the present name is PIT-RADWAR). Since then, tremendous progress in Poland in the development of applied technology in radio-communications has been observed. Many intentioned technologies invented by Professor Groszkowski were later applied in radars, the main two being the first oxide-coated cathode applied in magnetron (1937) [8] and the first metal magnetron with inner resonant circuits and an oxide cathode (1939) [9].","1557-959X","","10.1109/MAES.2017.160050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990421","","Magnetic circuits;Radar antennas;Cathodes;History;Electron tubes;Radio transmitters;Government;Magnetic resonance","magnetrons;oxide coated cathodes;radar;radio direction-finding;radio networks","Polish radar;Polish radiolocation;Warsaw University of Technology;radiocommunication technology;wave stability control;cathode wave;radiotelegraphy;Les Lampes a plusieures electrodes et leurs application;radiotechnique;State Telecommunications Institute;Poland;PIT;RADWAR;oxide-coated cathode;inner resonant circuit;metal magnetron;compensation method","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

RSSA is a very challenging problem since it introduces a new dimension, related to the selection of spatial resources, to the already complex (NP-hard) routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem. To allow solving large RSSA problem instances, in particular, in optical backbone networks with tens of nodes and hundreds of demands as well as with optical fibers supporting a numerous number of spatial modes, specialized optimization algorithms are required. In this paper, we propose and study several dedicated optimization procedures and some enhancements in algorithm processing, including parallel processing, which aim at both speeding up and increasing the effectiveness of the RSSA process and at estimating the quality of generated solutions. We combine the proposed procedures into an efficient optimization framework which, as presented numerical results show, is capable of providing high-quality solutions to large instances of the RSSA optimization problem in reasonable computation times. As a case study scenario, we consider an SS-FON with spectral super-channels (SChs) transmitted over bundles of single-mode fibers (SMFB) without spatial mode conversion. Nonetheless, the proposed optimization framework is generic and can be straightforwardly adapted to other SS-FON scenarios.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2019.2922761","Narodowe Centrum Nauki; Narodowe Centrum Nauki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746149","Optical networks;space division multiplexing;routing;space and spectrum allocation;offline planning;network optimization;meta-heuristic algorithm;parallel algorithm;column generation;lower bounds","Optimization;Optical fiber networks;Routing;Resource management;Planning;Optical switches","computational complexity;frequency allocation;optical fibre networks;optimisation;parallel processing;telecommunication network routing","SS-FON;spatial resources;optical backbone networks;optical fibers;specialized optimization algorithms;RSSA process;efficient optimization framework;RSSA optimization problem;spatial mode conversion;routing, spatial mode, and spectrum allocation problem;spectrally and spatially flexible optical networks;NP-hard routing;parallel processing;spectral super-channels;single-mode fibers;SMFB","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particularly for high-power converters with multiple coupled dynamics and tight operating constraints, model predictive control (MPC) is expected to evolve into the control method of choice. MPC allows one to increase lower the current distortions, reduce the converter hardware, achieve very fast transient responses, and ensure the reliable operation within safe operating area constraints. The first six chapters of this book offer a three phase power electronics, electrical machines, carrier-based pulsewidth modulation, optimized pulse patterns, state-of-the-art art converter control methods, and the principle of MPC. Chapters 7-14 include an in-depth treatment of MPC methods that fully exploit the performance potential of high-power converters. These control methods combine the fast control responses of deadbeat control with the optimal steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns by resolving the antagonism between the two. Each chapter is supplemented with an adequate well-selected list of recent references at the end. This is a well-written and richly illustrated text achieving a balance between mathematical rigor and physical insight.
