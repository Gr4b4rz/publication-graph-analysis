We want to present a spatial spin-wave modulator (SSM), allowing engineering of a spatial phase of spin-waves stored in a cold atomic memory. Using the SLM and polarizers we are able to shape a laser beam into an arbitrary shape. Such a prepared beam illuminates a cold rubidium cloud and due to ac-Stark effect the spatial phase of stored spin-waves is modified. The relative standard deviation of phase given by our SSM amounts to about 10%. We have also shown that losses scale quadratically with given phase. On one hand, that strongly limits the efficiency of SSM for strong phase modulation, but on the other hand enables efficient modulation in small range of several radians. During our research we have demonstrated a compensation of the quadratic phase introduced by a cylindrical lens placed in a readout path of our quantum memory. Moreover, introducing more complicated shapes of the ac-Stark beam, like saw or sine shape, we can shift and split spin-waves in Fourier domain [1]. Therefore we were able to interfere spin-waves stored in different spatial and temporal modes. This makes our SSM very robust tool which in conjugation with gradient echo memory can potentially allow to implement some new quantum protocols [2]. Finally, going to the single photon level we successfully observed a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two spin-waves stored in different spatial modes of our memory [3].",,978-1-7281-0469-0,10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2019.8871589,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8871589,,Phase modulation;Shape;Laser beams;Optics;Phase measurement;Rubidium,laser beams;lenses;light interference;optical modulation;optical storage;phase modulation;quantum optics;rubidium;spatial light modulators;spin waves;Stark effect,cylindrical lens;Hong-Ou-Mandel interference;single photon level;strong phase modulation;cold atomic memory;spatial phase;spatial light modulators;highly-multimode memories;multimode cold rubidium quantum memory;spatial spin-wave modulator;gradient echo memory;temporal modes;ac-Stark beam;quadratic phase;Rb,,,3,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Until 5 July 2016, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 17 729 artificial objects including 1419 operational satellites[1]. Information about the current position of these objects should be taken into consideration while planning space missions. There are various solutions to cope with the problem considered. The main objective was to design a low-cost system that would detect objects which do not emit their own signal and can cause collision with spacecrafts. The reception system is based on Doppler detection. One of the methods of gathering information about space objects which are changing their position relatively to the Earth is using the continuous wave reflection. The reflected outgoing sinusoidal wave is Doppler-shifted to higher or lower frequency according to whether it has a line of sight velocity towards or away from the receiver. It is also common to use this method for meteor detection. In this project we use signal emitted by the Graves Radar. Graves is a French radar-based space surveillance system which transmitter is located in the east of France and generates continuous wave with a frequency 143,05 MHz. In order to receive the reflected signal we built the passive radar which works on frequency similar to Graves. It is located 15 km to the south of Warsaw centre, thanks to its position it is possible to avoid radio noise coming from the city. Our construction includes directional antenna designed for 144 MHz and FUNcube Dongle Pro+. The FUNcube Dongle Pro+ is a software-defined radio (SDR) covering all broadcast andamateur radio bands from 150 kHz to 1,9 GHz. We use Orbitron as a software. Orbitron is an application related to satellite tracking. We can predict what kind of data will we receive from our construction by verifying it in application. Our first tests of the system were performed on objects with a well known trajectory and velocity. Also a correlation with data from two-line element set (TLE) was made. TLE is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time. Results show spectrogram of a signal reflected from satellite with a Doppler shift that fits our expectations. The flying object generated a Doppler shift of about 10 kHz below the carrier frequency. Although the first data come from objects with a large size and mass above 1 ton, in further observations we expect to receive reflection from satellites which mass is less than 10 kg.",,978-1-5090-6755-8,10.1109/SPS.2017.8053660,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053660,,Satellites;Orbits;Extraterrestrial measurements;Radar tracking;Satellite broadcasting,artificial satellites;directive antennas;Doppler shift;passive radar;radar antennas;satellite tracking;software radio;space debris;spaceborne radar,space debris;United States Strategic Command;space missions;low-cost system;reception system;Doppler detection;continuous wave reflection;meteor detection;Graves Radar;passive radar;frequency similar;Warsaw centre;radio noise;broadcast andamateur radio bands;satellite tracking;two-line element set;orbital elements;Earth-orbiting object;Doppler shift;flying object;carrier frequency;LEO satellites;space object detection;French radar-based space surveillance system;directional antenna;FUNcube Dongle Pro+;software-defined radio;SDR;frequency 10.0 kHz;frequency 150.0 kHz to 19.0 GHz;frequency 144.0 MHz,,1,9,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
